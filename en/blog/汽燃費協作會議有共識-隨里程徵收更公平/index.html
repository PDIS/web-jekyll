      <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>On November 30, 2018, PDIS held the 41st Collaborative Meeting in the Information Center of the Ministry of Finance to discuss "<a href="https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail /c038fdae-0667-45b0-93cd-0ab761338758">Automobile fuel tax changed with oil</a> Proposal. On June 29th, the case was proposed by netizen billy on the Join platform. He pointed out that the fuel consumption fee for motor vehicles is to repair the road surface. It should be levied with oil according to the principle of user payment, using mass transportation vehicles. People do not have to be forced to pay extra fees, and drivers who use more roads have the power to save fuel and reduce carbon.</p>

<p>According to Article 27 of the <a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/lawclass/lawall.aspx?pcode=k0040001">Road Law</a>: “the highway authority, for road maintenance, construction and for the safety management, it is necessary to levy a vehicle fuel use fee (hereinafter referred to as "steam fuel charge"…". from this, it can be seen that the fuel charge is collected for road maintenance, construction and safety management. the current collection method is based on the vehicle. the fixed fee is levied each year (season) for the type, purpose of use (self-use or business) and displacement.</p>

<h4 id="there-are-three-similar-systems-in-the-gas-burning-fee-collection-schemes">There are three similar systems in the gas burning fee collection schemes</h4>

<p>Every country has a similar system to collect related expenses to maintain the road surface, but according to the calculation method, it can be divided into Collected by car, "levied with oil" and "levied with mileage".</p>

<p>The levy on the vehicle is generally levied on the weight of the vehicle. In Taiwan, the displacement is calculated based on the displacement of the vehicle. Although the collection cost is relatively low, it is less in line with the principle of "user pays". With oil, it is levied with fuel, but nowadays, with the continuous innovation of technology, it is necessary to consider the situation in which the roads such as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles do not use oil, and the situation in which oil is not used, such as agricultural machinery and generators. In terms of oil and so on, it is more difficult to plan, and it is even necessary to create additional pipelines in response to the situation of electric vehicles. With regard to mileage collection, although it is more in line with the principle of user payment, I am afraid that it is necessary to install the corresponding interface on the vehicle to record, or to need to transmit and log in the pipeline, which is more complicated and may also violate privacy. Doubt.</p>

<p>According to the Research Report of the [Automotive Fuel Consumption Fee Collection System] made by the Transportation Research Institute of the Ministry of Communications in October 2017 (https://www.iot.gov.tw/file.ashx?id=9fc1e9c8 -a2f5-4e2a-a243-c8a2a8bc53cd)", as well as pre-interview interviews, the factors that people, government or industry care about are not the same.</p>

<p>For the public, the elements they care about are fair, simple, and private. In terms of fairness, the public hopes to implement the principle of user payment, so that the payment can be more fair; the fee collection mechanism should be simple and convenient, if it is too unsocial, it may lead to public grievances; in the end, it is hoped to protect privacy and not excessively expose too many personal actions. Information to the government.</p>

<p>But the government's focus is on administrative costs, law enforcement, impact on the transportation industry, and income from finance. In terms of administrative costs, the government does not want the administrative costs to be too high, resulting in a larger workload for civil servants. In law enforcement, the relevant fee collection mechanism cannot be illegal, beyond the authority of the government, and cannot be implemented and cannot be implemented; if the transportation industry costs increase due to charges It may affect prices and cause public grievances; in financial terms, the new fee collection mechanism cannot lead to insufficient fees. As for the relevant industry players, most of them do not want to change the fee mechanism to increase operating costs.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that regardless of the method of collection of steam fuel costs, it should ensure that the financial resources are stable to meet the requirements for road maintenance and construction and safety management. Changes in the mode of expropriation should avoid a substantial increase in administrative costs, and minimize the level of socio-economic impact, and choose the right time to promote.</p>

<h4 id="with-the-oil-collection-problem-with-the-mileage-collection-program-ministry-of-communications-research">With the oil collection problem with the mileage collection program Ministry of Communications research</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the meeting, the Ministry of Communications explained that in order to avoid public misunderstanding, the Ministry of Communications recommended that the fuel burning fee be renamed Road maintenance fees, so as not to be confused with foreign fuel taxes. Regarding the content of the proposal, the Ministry of Communications said that according to the constitutional content of the Chief Justice, there is no problem with the collection of steam fuel charges. If it is levied with oil, such as the passenger transportation and taxis that were originally exempted, how to collect them in the future and how to refund them is a problem. At the same time, with the oil collection, prices may also rise, which may require more social communication.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation shared the foreign case and pointed out that due to the fuel efficiency of many vehicles, the fuel tax revenue has also been continuously reduced, and because of the increasing number of electric vehicles, the US fuel tax has gradually evolved under fair consideration. Turn to "road use fees." Currently in the US state of Oregon, it has been piloted. In 2015, the two-track system was implemented. About 700 vehicles are using the “road use fee”. Washington State and California are also actively testing the mileage-levied scheme.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications also pointed out that according to the American AASHTO design guidelines, the damage degree of pavements of different vehicles is about 4 times of the axle load ratio. The damage caused by heavy trucks to the pavement and the maintenance cost in the future are much higher than the average. For self-use vehicles, in the future, it is possible to establish a fee collection mechanism with the weight of the vehicle plus the mileage of the vehicle.</p>

<p>On November 13, 2017, the Legislative Yuan has decided to ask the Ministry of Communications to conduct relevant research on the mileage collection as soon as possible. The current study will be closed on May 29, 2019. The Ministry of Communications pointed out that the future discussion includes five levels, including feasible technologies, discussions on privacy, charging systems, and information security. The administrative level should consider how to save personnel costs. The most important part is the financial aspect. In order to take into account the stability and sustainability of finance, we need to know how much money we need to receive in the future. Since the gas burning fee collection system involves people's rights and interests, the Ministry of Communications will also develop plans and field test plans in the future, and then make policy decisions.</p>

<p>The Touring Car Dealer believes that the current Ministry of Communications' exemption policy is only for mass transportation and taxis. It is not fair in the industrial circle. The tour bus is also a kind of mass transportation and should also be included in the exemption scope. The gas station trade union pointed out that the current air pollution charges were imposed, which led to an increase in the oil price of the gas station, which increased the turnover of the gas station, increased the business tax, and increased the handling fee of the bank card, thereby reducing the profit of the gas station. They are worried that if the fuel cost is levied with the oil, I am afraid that a similar situation will occur, which will lower the profit of the gas station.</p>

<p>For the charging plan, some people pointed out that the Ministry of Transportation’s charging standard now estimates the weight of the vehicle by the amount of exhaust, but now even large-scale transportation vehicles are lighter, and the large displacement may not necessarily represent the weight of the vehicle. . He believes that such a standard is probably the result of the Ministry of Communications's cheaper actions. It is recommended that the weight of the vehicle be used as the charging standard. As for the name changed to the road management fee, he thinks that there is no problem.</p>

<p>Another participant pointed out that the government should maintain good accountability and use market mechanisms to make the system better. It has also been pointed out that they hope that the quality of the road surface can be better, not to build roads too frequently, resulting in poor road quality.</p>

<h4 id="us-oregon-province-builds-a-mileage-based-system-with-new-technology">US Oregon Province builds a mileage-based system with new technology</h4>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation shares the technology of mileage collection. The Oregon State requires OBD2 to be installed on a new car. It will detect the speed and oil condition; OBD2 will transfer the mileage and GPS data to the management platform. The Ministry of Communications team said that their research team is currently studying several programs, such as car code tables, but they are worried that they will be tampered with; if OBD2 is used, the advantage is that it can be read, but there may be errors; if the returned data contains GPS, There may be issues that violate personal privacy.</p>

<p>The other is OBE, for example, OBU with many car networking technologies; Beacon can also be connected to the mobile phone using near-field communication, and then return the information. Using ETC detection may also be a method, but it may become that ETC is installed on every road, which may be troublesome. The Ministry of Communications pointed out that Beacon's new mobile phone and the possibility of using ETC tracking are relatively low, so the main evaluation of the first three options, namely the code table, OBD2 and OBE. The Ministry of Communications pointed out that a feasible plan is currently being developed, and the industry will come back to discuss it in the future.</p>

<h4 id="create-a-new-form-to-help-the-group-focus-on-the-discussion">Create a new form to help the group focus on the discussion</h4>

<p>In order to facilitate discussion, the afternoon discussion produced a different form to help you discuss. The table is divided into four quadrants, representing the status quo, with the oil collection, with mileage and mileage + vehicle weight and other four programs; in the current situation, the plan is also included in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Each program has its own fields of fairness, complexity, administrative costs, related industry costs, user costs, and “other” fields to classify the types of opinions of participants.</p>

<p>After the group discussion, it is followed by the time of each group report.</p>

<h4 id="discussion-in-each-group-believes-that-the-mileage-is-more-fair">Discussion in each group believes that the mileage is more fair</h4>

<p>The first group pointed out that if "maintaining the current situation", regardless of the actual road conditions, all the equal costs will be paid. More similar to the public welfare mentioned in other advanced conferences than fairness. They believe that the current classification of exhaust gas has nothing to do with the actual frequency of use and road damage, which is unfair. Perhaps this collection method is simple and simple, but now it seems to be a bit cheaper. This set of recommendations, the levy standard should be recalculated. Since the public has no way to identify how the 50 billion levy is distributed to the actual use and support of local governments, the fairness of the levy will be repeatedly verified.</p>

<p>Although there is no other technology in the current stage, the "levy with oil" program can best reflect the situation on the road, but the progress of science and technology makes the fuel consumption performance better and better, and the use of oil does not represent the road. The situation may be doubtful in fairness and justice. At the same time, the implementation of the gas station identification mechanism may be required. The administrative work is relatively complicated, and the increased operating expenses may also lead to loss at the gas station. For oil and electric vehicles, electric vehicles may also require additional matching methods.</p>

<p>In the part of the mileage collection, according to the report of the Institute of Transportation, in the international trend, in order to stabilize the financial resources and truly reflect the status of the vehicles, the countries have changed their mileage in recent years. It is undeniable that this may be the final The fairest way. If you want to make the actual damage degree of the road can be measured, you can add the weight of the car as a consideration. However, the burden of government investment in construction costs and on-board installation costs is quite large. When technology is fully licensed and mature, it can be popularized with mileage. At the same time, the government may consider personal privacy in addition to collecting mileage. The part of protection should protect personal data in accordance with the individual law. In response to the increase in costs of related businesses, the government needs to consider supporting the use as a stable price. The first group also suggested that all fees should be divided into business and own use, and plan different payment plans. The second group believes that the cost of steam fuel charges is necessary, but in the method of collection, it can be considered to adjust the base fee plus the way of collecting according to different usage conditions. In the current situation, the second group pointed out that some business vehicles are for the public interest, so there is no need to levy steam fuel costs, but they still have damage and use on the road surface, which may be unfair. In terms of calculation standards, the second group believes that the standard calculated by the exhaust volume is outdated and can be calculated by using horsepower and vehicle weight. As part of the oil collection, the second group is concerned that the electric vehicle will not receive the cost; at the same time, the fuel consumption of the car may not be completely fair. If you want to consider the use of oil purchases, it will be more difficult to collect fees. The second group also believes that if the cost is charged by the gas station, it is necessary to be careful that the fee is included in the business tax, resulting in additional taxes on the gas station. It may be possible to give the fuel dispensers a modest fee and compensate for such losses.</p>

<p>Most of the participants in the second group believe that the mileage is more fair, and it is recommended to set the basic fee and then add the fee according to the different mileage. The second group also suggested that it is more fair to add the weight of the vehicle as a calculation factor. However, the second group pointed out that there may be ways to distinguish the rates of highways or other roads, and the reliability of mileage is also a problem. They suggested that the government can set standards so that the industry can compete fairly, as long as it can make standards-compliant ways to compete in this market and promote the development of the industry. In the system design, we must consider the old car that can not use the new technology, as well as the cost of installing the new car. The second group of discussions also mentioned the Japanese tax system, which can be taxed on the weight of the car, plus mileage fees, combined to become a new road use fee.</p>

<p>But the second group also reminds that people who are in the middle of the country may need to have a corresponding package to give relief because they do not have public transportation means, otherwise it may be unfair. How to pass back the mileage of the local network environment is also a problem. In the early stage of the second group of proposals, the two-track parallel approach can be used to allow the public to choose the current method, or to add mileage pricing, and then consider the industry status to set a sufficient time limit so that the industry can have sufficient time to introduce it in stages.</p>

<p>Tang Feng concluded that the results of this meeting will be shared with the dean or other political council members at the government meeting next Monday after the team is fully organized. If there is a clear cut, it will make relevant The open government contact person knows; the hosted ministry will also share the discussion thread and the comprehensive comments of the meeting to the second person on the platform of the agreement, the future <a href="https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov. tw/2018-11-30-%e9%96%8b%e6%94%be%e6%94%bf%e5%ba%9c%e8%81%af%e7%b5%a1%e4%ba%ba %e7%ac%ac%e5%9b%9b%e5%8d%81%e4%b8%80%e6%ac%a1%e5%8d%94%e4%bd%9c%e6%9c%83%e8 %ad%b0">Verbatim Draft</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r98q8vigmbtppljwzj68ey5-4hezzijt82uqaszie4w/edit">issue manual</a>, <a href="https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9j_kyje69o related information such as =/">mind map</a> will also be made public. However, since the fuel burning fee involves legal amendments, even if the name is changed, it is necessary to return to the Legislative Yuan for processing. But if other legislators are interested in this matter in the future, they can refer to the information of this meeting to discuss it, and they will not discuss the same issue again and again. Finally, Tang Feng sincerely thanked the friends who attended the meeting, "Thank you for your advancement in legislation and administrative quality."</p>

<h4 id="the-director-of-the-table-led-the-discussion-to-be-well-received-the-appreciator-agreed-with-the-direction-of-the-ministry-of-communications">The director of the table led the discussion to be well received. The appreciator agreed with the direction of the Ministry of Communications.</h4>

<p>The civil servants who attended the meeting said that the meeting was as expected, but some tools were used, such as Mind map, they are hard to master. Trade union representatives are more concerned about the continuity of the policy. I hope that the government's policies will have consistent results and will not change at any time. Some people suggest that stakeholders can be more subdivided. For example, in this mileage-levied scheme, the garage is an important role in confirming the correctness of OBD, and their lack may be relatively important.</p>

<p>The second party believes that the government should not only hear the voice of the industry, but also the voice of the consumer group. Otherwise, it may end up with the consortium and manufacturers. They pointed out that the general public may think "how to discuss for so long?" They often feel that the official response is slow and half-time, and I hope to know when there will be changes. At the same time, they also pointed out that the people want the explanations that are easy to understand, and some of them are too literary and may not help communication. They hope that they will not want to find someone to come to the meeting and become a meeting, or that the government can be good for the country and listen to the voice of the people in the future.</p>

<p>For this meeting, the congressors at the meeting thought it would be helpful. When the discussion of the group was divergent, the table leader would pull back the discussion in due course. Some people in the public sector will come up with ideas that they have not heard before, and many union representatives share practical problems. The congressmen who help to discuss together understand the ideas of different stakeholders. The second person said that they would agree with the direction of the Ministry of Transportation to collect the mileage, and they will continue to care about this issue in the future.</p>

<p>The participating scholars said that the team's ability to gather and information is very strong, so it can be effectively discussed; when the group discussion, everyone can further discuss specific suggestions from emotional or intuitive speech, the public department can let It is very useful and valuable for the public sector to provide opinions, participate in the process of policy planning, and make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of the program. However, he believes that the stakeholder is not diversified. Although there are many people in the industry, the voice of the second person is not enough. It is suggested that people with more different positions can be invited to participate. The scholar shared that in this meeting, he felt that there was a good chance of citizen participation.</p>
