        <p>For a long time, parents of twins have been under heavy pressure for childcare because they take care of two children of the same age. On October 18, 2017, the 20th Collaboration Meeting was held at the Information Center of the Ministry of Finance. The members of the sponsors' Twins Association collaborated with relevant government ministries to discuss the relevant issues behind the twin issues (https://Join.gov.tw/idea/detail/e072e742-8f8d-421a-a5cc-407cfbc27724){:target="_blank"}, and possible resolutions under the current regulatory framework, providing government ministry as a follow-up to policy planning reference.</p>

<h4 id="twin-families-highlighting-the-lack-of-childcare-policy">Twin families, highlighting the lack of childcare policy</h4>

<p>According to the discussion at the meeting, the main source of this issue is the difficulty of Taiwan's childcare. A child's family has faced various problems such as the difficulty of pumping the public, the high cost of private care, and the reduction of disposable income. The twins are under double pressure. However, <a href="https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/6a024fc8-ceb3-45cc-a37a-59cbec2d6bd4">the previous collaborative meeting has dealt with the issue of public trust, public and young</a>, so this time does not deal with issues such as increasing public trust, public and young, and focusing on the special problems faced by twins, such as the problem of drawing lots. The sponsors pointed out that in many cases, when there is only one quota left, only one of the twins will be drawn, and the other child will not be able to attend the same public order, causing trouble for the parents. The sponsors hope to provide a "co-signing" mechanism, and after a child is drawn, another child can attend together.</p>

<p>However, after discussion, some practices may create unfairness, which in turn makes everyone feel that the twin family has privileges. Therefore, at the end of the discussion, everyone thinks that in the current situation, "one child is signed, another child is prepared", in the future, the twins can be considered as the second priority in the lottery, and the opportunity to be in the same public, public and young is increased.</p>

<p>The on-site sponsor also pointed out that twins are equivalent to "pay-as-you-go" compared to the "instalment payment" of a second-child family. It is also mentioned that since the national small is compulsory, many parents enter the national small school. After that, economic pressure can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the site has come up with the idea of ​​whether it is possible to provide a preferential loan for parents. After the child is born, he can provide a parental living loan to pay a high amount of childcare expenses, and then return to the child after attending primary school. However, this involves the question of the competent authorities. After on-the-spot discussions, it was found that it seemed difficult to find the main authority.</p>

<p>The results of the discussion will be gathered to <a href="https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9j_k0qrkko=/">whiteboard</a>, by Tang Feng at the Monday meeting The director and the relevant political commissars and ministers explained to them to let them know the results of this discussion and use them as a reference for future policy formulation.</p>

<h4 id="collaborative-meeting-the-ministry-will-have-the-opportunity-to-comprehensively-respond">Collaborative meeting, the Ministry will have the opportunity to comprehensively respond</h4>

<p>The proponents pointed out that the information they received in the past was mostly shared from various communities, and the information was not consistent. After this collaborative meeting, we can see that the various ministries and even local governments can participate together, and they can have a more comprehensive understanding of the current situation of the government. They originally thought that the collaborative meeting would only find the grassroots civil servants in the government to send everyone. It is a surprise that the collaborative meeting can invite senior officials to work together with the people to clarify the issues. The sponsors said that if they know that today's collaborative meeting hopes to absorb more different positions, they will also recommend social workers who help disadvantaged families, as well as scholars and experts who study the issue of nursery, to provide more diversity. View. Everyone also found that the public trust and public and child policies are mainly blamed by local governments. At present, Hsinchu City is the county with the largest number of twins in the country. However, it seems a pity that the local government colleagues attending the conference are only Taipei City and New Taipei City. If the host can stand in different roles to help organize, ask and focus on the problem, it will help everyone to think differently and find out possible solutions. The sponsors used the "living loan" as an example. In the past, they did not think of the "loan" method when they pushed the issue. In the future, they will refer to the results of this collaborative meeting as a reference for their future initiatives.</p>

 <figcaption> From the central to the local government colleagues discuss with the people </figcaption> 
 </figure>

<p>Local government colleagues pointed out that citizen participation is a trend, giving civil servants a chance to get in touch with the people. There is an opportunity for direct face-to-face communication. Public officials can express their own problems with the people and find out together. A possible alternative, but the price is to spend time. This colleague had previously participated in a citizen cafe. He found that the citizen cafe is more suitable for dealing with more and wider issues, and the form of this collaborative meeting can focus on the problem and further find possible solutions. However, local government colleagues also said that there was a lack of intermediation coordinators when discussing these issues in the past. If there is a neutral moderator as a coordinator, it can be used as a buffer to make the discussion more rational and peaceful. On the other hand, it can also promote mutual understanding and reduce misunderstandings in dialogue. After all, some topics are easy to ask questions, and they can be pulled back in time to reduce the time spent on topics that have already been discussed. This will make the discussion of the meeting more efficient. For the ministry, there is also a chance to make relevant policy statements. clear.</p>

<p>As for this mode can be copied to other places? Local government colleagues pointed out that compared with past meetings, such a form still requires the government to invest time and cost. In which cases can be used, further evaluation is still needed.</p>

<p>Person member of the PDIS in Japan just happened to explain the operation mode of the PDIS collaborative meeting with friends in Japan, and broadcast the live video of this meeting on the spot for friends to watch. Japanese friends lamented that the Taiwan government is willing to disclose the process and use a lot of technology to help the discussion. I hope that the Japanese government can do the same.</p>
