However, the colleagues in the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) must regularly make “one-minute phone calls” that can only be hung up at the last second.</p>

<p>This one-minute phone call is an important step to ensure the quality of communication everywhere. When the inspection staff arrives on site, the engineer will connect and capture the signal of the nearest base station, then connect to the operator’s system end, conduct a hundred reaction tests, and confirm that the network is smooth. The last phone call must last for one minute without interruption. Both the network and voice calls must meet the standard to pass the test.</p>

<p>Compared to the inspection completed within ten minutes, what is more time-consuming is to reach the inspection point. In May, colleagues from the moda and various telecommunications operators went to the 99 Mountain Villa on the top of Daba Peak, the Zhongba Mountain House at an altitude of 3,300 meters, and the Cuifeng Mountain House on Taiping Mountain to conduct forest communication measurements.</p>

<p>These long journeys are not only to provide hikers and tourists with fast and convenient communication quality, but also to enhance the digital resilience of various places and solve life problems through the internet.</p>

<p>For example, Taiwan is full of high mountains and vast territories. If there is an emergency medical need in the mountains, it is often restricted by transportation and affects medical treatment. Therefore, the moda supports telecommunications operators to develop 5G remote diagnosis and treatment platforms, which can transmit medical images in real time and allow specialist doctors to read them remotely.</p>

<p>Take the example of Ren’ai Township in Nantou County, where many tribes are deep in the mountains. The doctor of the health center can let the dermatologist see the patient’s lesions from a distance through video, making the diagnosis more accurate. This system has been used in twelve counties and cities and thirty-five townships, serving more than 30,000 people.</p>

<p>This method of “replacing roads with the internet” effectively meets life needs and is the original intention of the moda to continue promoting 5G applications. Therefore, we focus on “reducing costs”, “opening applications”, and “simplifying procedures” as the core, and officially open the application of 5G dedicated frequency dedicated network in June.</p>

<p>In order to encourage more industries to use it, the Administration for Digital Industries has formed a promotion group with thirteen public associations, including tourism, cultural performances, livelihood and manufacturing, etc., to propose industry blueprints for dedicated frequency dedicated network services and application solutions, and continue to participate in and support innovative applications.</p>

<p>For example, the immersive experience version of the Bell Ringing Drama Troupe “VALO Trilogy-Island” is supported by the Digital Department, telecommunications operators, and the Institute for Information Industry, allowing the four-story space of the National Theater to be filled with 5G signals and control 1,200 light source carriers. After the audience wears a 5G bracelet, they can be in the same fantasy world as the dancers and interact in real time.</p>

<p>This approach showcases the characteristics of 5G’s broad connectivity and low latency. The setup of more than a thousand signals not only ensures coverage in every corner of the venue but also significantly reduces the network connection delay time from an average of one second to 0.1 second. This allows the live performance and the audio-visual experience to be perfectly combined.</p>

<p>From one-minute phone calls to low-latency rates of 0.1 seconds, we continue to improve network quality. This allows 5G applications to become a helpful tool for everyday life and a new driving force for industries to move forward.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Communications and Cyber Resilience" /><category term="Resource Management" /><category term="Digital Industries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5G remote diagnosis and treatment platforms can transmit medical images in real time.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/nature-g62a81da2f_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/nature-g62a81da2f_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital public infrastructure, shared by all</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD-%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital public infrastructure, shared by all" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD-%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB/"><![CDATA[<p>Alain Richard, Vice President of the French Senate, led the Senate Friendship Group to Taiwan to visit the Digital Department at the end of April. Members of the French political parties are most curious about how to design a system to smoothly promote digital services? I said that this is the result of long-term accumulation of inter-ministerial committees. The current “universal cash for all people” is the best example.</p>

<p>Public cash policy is based on triple- and quintuple-stimulus vouchers. Take the collection channel as an example. After the digital voucher is used up, you can choose to receive cash. At that time, only some banks’ automatic teller machines (ATM) supported it. This time we have promoted more banks to join, covering more than 80% of the country, serving more than 4 million people, and receiving 6,000 yuan directly at ATMs.</p>

<p>For friends who are inconvenient to collect in person, you can also register online on the official website, and let the cash be directly transferred to your account. The “children’s family epidemic prevention subsidy” system established in 2021 can not only ensure the guardianship relationship between the child and the recipient, but also allow the recipient to decide which account to remit to. Become the core structure of this popularization of gold.</p>

<p>Before the system was launched, the colleagues of the National Information Security Research Institute have comprehensively detected the weaknesses of information security, ensured that the entire transmission process is encrypted, and access to data must be authorized and recorded. Personal information is not only strictly protected, but will also be deleted one month after the completion of the project.</p>

<p>The targets of this issuance include foreign nationals holding permanent residence permits. Therefore, the Pufa Cash website is set up in a bilingual structure to avoid obstacles caused by language skills; Conforms to the AA level specification of the accessibility mark.</p>

<p>These practices not only make the website easier to use, but also take care of the needs of people with disabilities. Even if people access the system with their mobile phones during their busy commuting, they can still experience a clear, easy-to-understand and error-free usage process.</p>

<p>The smooth general distribution has come to an end, how to properly use this mechanism that combines identity verification, information flow, and cash flow in the future? We plan to expand this mechanism into “digital public construction” and provide it to government agencies at all levels for distribution operations; based on the spirit of public code, we will also provide value-added use of codes to various agencies to speed up system construction efficiency.</p>

<p>In addition, we will also import “T-Road cross-organization data transmission exclusive channel”, the whole process is encrypted with agency certificates, and will not be connected to external service network segments. Normally, the transmission interface is closed through T-Road, and the T-Road interface transmission can only be activated after the distribution operation is started and the competent authority and the personal information agency confirm the scope of access. In this way, agencies at all levels can ensure the security of personal information when performing distribution operations in the future.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the number of general cash recipients has exceeded 20 million, of which more than 9 million people have received online through the official website. The Ministry of Digital Affairs will continue to collaborate with various ministries to create more labor-saving and safe public programs, so that the public can obtain convenient services in multiple ways.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Service" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to properly use this mechanism that combines identity verification, information flow, and cash flow in the future?]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/technology-5348129_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/technology-5348129_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Informed Data Governance, Rational Data Altruism</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Informed Data Governance, Rational Data Altruism" /><published>2023-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86/"><![CDATA[<p>This book is the crystallization of wisdom jointly created by academics and practitioners in the field of digital governance, following the publication of “Government Digital Transformation: An Essential Guide”. This time, the authors focus on “government data governance”, once again demonstrating their profound professional expertise.</p>

<p>If digital transformation is likened to the Industrial Revolution, data is the new energy driving the wheels of the times. Just as the development and utilization of energy are vital to the success of industries, data governance is the cornerstone of digital transformation.</p>

<p>Today, with the popularization of audiovisual and language models, businesses ranging from translation, customer service, marketing, and content creation are all impacted by generative technologies. Just like advancement of refining technology has liberated fossil fuels from primitive uses such as lighting and heating — not only producing powerful propulsion for land, sea, and air vehicles but also generating countless plastic products, permeating every aspect of food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment — the prevalence of foundation models spurs global investment in data applications, unleashing boundless creativity.</p>

<p>However, just as petrochemical products have triggered climate crises and ecological disasters, leading to the pursuit of clean energy as a century-long challenge, foundation models are closely related to large datasets from training to application. If there is no foundation for proper governance, cyber-ecological disasters are imminent, with deepfake scams being just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the international community is paying close attention to governance issues, expecting legal, ethical, and technological advancements to proceed hand in hand. At the G7 Digital and Technology Ministers’ Meeting held in Japan in late April, a joint statement was issued, pledging to promote “human-centric” principles to maximize benefits for all and oppose misuse and abuse that undermines democracy, freedom, and human rights. The statement echoes the spirit of the “Declaration of the Summit for Democracy” and the “Declaration for the Future of Internet”, pointing out that a “Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT)” mechanism is the top priority for cross-border collaboration.</p>

<p>In other words, in the face of rapidly developing technologies such as foundation models, even if there are concerns about harms to human rights and democratic values, “free flow” remains the primary value of cross-border data governance, rather than building isolated strongholds or resorting to government regulation to reject data flow, turning advanced countries into “prohibition-first” countries.</p>

<p>The five principles put forward in the statement — “rule of law”, “due process”, “democracy”, “respect for human rights” and “harnessing the opportunities of innovation” — can be summed up as “human centric”, firmly defending the value and protection of individuals as data subjects. Just like the well-known fable, if governments cannot sincerely face the lost iron axe, they will not be rewarded with golden and silver axes.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs was established in response to public expectations, with the mission of “government digital services, data governance, and open data”. As a supplement to legal and ethical norms, we promote Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and actively assist e-commerce and logistics companies in adopting them to reduce the risk of personal data breaches.</p>

<p>Observing international trends, the European Union recently advocated privacy-enhancing processing, proactively transforming high-value data into non-personal data, promoting applications across various sectors for public benefit.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, public-benefit applications such as climate and environment, disaster prevention and rescue, transportation, health care, energy management, and social assistance all have corresponding “high-value” topics on the data.gov.tw platform, inspiring endless innovative solutions. Over the past decade, the platform has attracted 113 million views and over 19 million downloads, and through events like the “Presidential Hackathon”, it inspired a myriad of practical co-creations.</p>

<p>In other words, the “oil analogy” mentioned in this book may only be half right; oil and minerals are rival goods, but data is quite the opposite, possessing “non-exclusivity” and “non-competitiveness”. Under a governance environment built on sound legal systems and privacy-enhancing technologies, data can exhibit “anti-rival good” characteristics: the more it is shared, the greater its value, contributing to both individuals and the world.</p>

<p>That is to say, only in an environment of free flow with trust can the “data altruism” concept proposed by the European Union’s Data Governance Act (DGA) be realized: data holders voluntarily provide data to drive societal development and improve public service quality.</p>

<p>As foundation models become popular, the vision of “data democratization” in Chapter 10 of this book is about to be realized, with everyone expected to become a producer and user, and “data governance” becoming a core issue in digital development. The publication of this book will undoubtedly guide all sectors to achieve informed and rational data governance. Only by pooling the collective intelligence can we establish mutual connections, foster virtuous collaborations toward the common good, and realize “data altruism” in a rational and principled fashion. It is my pleasure to write this foreword.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Plural Innovation" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA["Data Free Flow with Trust" is the top priority for cross-border collaboration.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/binary-ga626d4a1f_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/binary-ga626d4a1f_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ten years of open data, opening up an infinite future</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8D%81%E5%B9%B4%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99-%E9%96%8B%E5%95%9F%E7%84%A1%E9%99%90%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ten years of open data, opening up an infinite future" /><published>2023-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8D%81%E5%B9%B4%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99-%E9%96%8B%E5%95%9F%E7%84%A1%E9%99%90%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%8D%81%E5%B9%B4%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99-%E9%96%8B%E5%95%9F%E7%84%A1%E9%99%90%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86/"><![CDATA[<p>April of this year marks a significant milestone in Taiwan’s development of open data, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the “Government Open Data Platform.” Today, the platform has opened access to more than 55,000 datasets, boasting over 110 million views and 19 million downloads.</p>

<p>Over the years, numerous creative applications that address social issues have emerged from the foundation of open data. For example, innovative ideas, such as an irrigation system that combines rainwater warnings and a smart system designed to help farmers and fishermen cultivate clams, have been proposed by contestants in data application competitions in recent years.</p>

<p>The key to the success of these ideas lies in the continuous release of various types of high impact data by government agencies.</p>

<p>In the past, high impact data with significant public value, such as meteorological observations and disaster relief resources, often faced legal and computational constraints, preventing their easy release. Over the past decade, the government has persevered in overcoming these challenges to provide data for public use.</p>

<p>For instance, the Central Weather Bureau’s “Meteorological Resources Innovation Application Plan,” announced in 2022, opened up access to high-precision meteorological data and resources for legal entities and businesses. This not only improves the accuracy of weather forecasts but also enables the development of targeted meteorological and ocean current analyses for industries like fisheries and shipping.</p>

<p>This case study demonstrates the potential for high-value application data to connect different industries and professions. After soliciting opinions from various ministries and the public, the Digital Ministry has established a “High Application Value Thematic Area” on the Government Open Data Platform.</p>

<p>Departing from the previous classification based on industry or agency, we now categorize data based on “themes” according to social value and content. Initially, six data sets were classified: climate and environment, disaster prevention and rescue, transportation, health and medical care, energy management, and social assistance. Theme-based planning not only aids in data search but also reveals the connections between different data sets, stimulating further collaboration.</p>

<p>For example, the “climate and environment” dataset can contribute to the net-zero transition. The goal of “net-zero” is to minimize human-induced greenhouse gas emissions while offsetting them through negative emissions technologies and forest carbon sinks. In line with the 2021 United Nations Glasgow Climate Agreement, Taiwan proposed a “2050 Net-Zero Emissions Pathway” in March last year and officially implemented the “Climate Change Response Act” this year.</p>

<p>The theme of this year’s Presidential Hackathon International Track, “#FreeTheFuture: Open, Digital &amp; Green,” combines democratic communication, data application, and net-zero carbon emissions, presenting an excellent opportunity for interdisciplinary data sharing and use.</p>

<p>Earth’s natural resources, often depleted due to human over-exploitation, are considered competitive assets, leaving less for future generations. In contrast, open data serves as an “anti-rival good,” where sharing increases its value and contributes to both individuals and the world.</p>

<p>The Digital Ministry will continue to promote the opening and application of data for public good, assisting in the sustainable use of scarce global resources, and welcoming more friends to join our ranks.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Plural Innovation" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data for public good assists the sustainable use of scarce global resources.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/earth-gab4518d56_1920.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/earth-gab4518d56_1920.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Summit for Democracy: Shaping emerging technologies to align with human rights and democratic principles</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summit for Democracy: Shaping emerging technologies to align with human rights and democratic principles" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87/"><![CDATA[<p>Good local time, everyone. I’m Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister.</p>

<p>It is a genuine honor to participate in the second Summit for Democracy. I will share Taiwan’s experiences in tackling common challenges facing our free and open societies and how emerging technologies strengthen human rights and democratic principles.</p>

<p>Since the inaugural Summit for Democracy in December 2021, the world has fundamentally changed. Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has sent shockwaves throughout the international community.</p>

<p>As democracies adapt to this reality, Taiwan shines brightly as a trustworthy and most reliable partner in promoting digital resilience. During the darkest days of COVID-19, our industries rose to the challenge, becoming a potent producer of essential medical supplies. Our civic technology supported the emergence of the Taiwan Can Help model in a global counter-pandemic coalition.</p>

<p>Based on this rock-solid foundation of collaboration, I signed the Declaration for the Future of the Internet in 2022, along with 60 partner countries. The declaration cemented our shared values and
deepened our commitment to democratic allies, paving the way to free the future in the digital realm together.</p>

<p>At the heart of this vision is the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda), and its objective of “digital resilience for all.” This comprises three levels: Emergency, industrial, and societal resilience.</p>

<p>Emergency resilience impels us to effectively respond to various crises, including cyberattacks and natural disasters. Recent incidents, such as those during the former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s historic visit to Taiwan, unsuccessfully attempted to undermine public trust in our democratic system.</p>

<p>To counter emerging threats, including AI-powered interactive deep fakes, we are consolidating public and private cybersecurity capabilities,
implementing zero-trust principles, and conducting exercises to ensure the seamless operation of critical infrastructure during emergencies.</p>

<p>Starting this year, we’re integrating new satellite providers, enabling multiple networks to reinforce one another across land, sea, and air in times of crisis. The moda website uses IPFS, an emerging technology
for censorship resistance, so everyone can donate connectivity to back us up, while also supporting journalists in autocracies so their reportage remains tamper-free.</p>

<p>Industrial resilience is our commitment to facilitating digital transformation across all sectors while fostering a robust ecosystem. Taiwan possesses a highly advanced IT industry with a world-class semiconductor supply chain and a wealth of experience neutralizing cyberthreats. With global standards such as SEMI E187, we
elevate the Made in Taiwan brand to represent a guarantee of integrity and a solid shield to our democratic partners.</p>

<p>Societal resilience focuses on empowering our civil society by connecting to the democracy network. The moda initiated the Digital News Co-prosperity dialogues with global platforms and brought together the Ministry of Culture, National Communications Commission, and Fair Trade Commission to explore ways of fostering mutually beneficial cooperation with Taiwan’s print, broadcast, and digital journalists.</p>

<p>We believe that accurate news reporting is the bedrock of democracy, and digital competence requires a well-informed and discerning citizenry. In the face of authoritarian expansionism, democracies must confront formidable challenges undermining the delicate equilibrium between societal well-being and individual freedoms. Our efforts must go beyond devising protective measures — we’re envisioning a trajectory embracing the triad of participation, progress, and safety through the power of collective intelligence.</p>

<p>This approach is embodied in the moda’s overarching vision: Plurality, or collaborative diversity. When people from all walks of life can form
digital public spaces together, we can empower the voices reaching across ideological divides and uncover our shared values in plain sight.</p>

<p>As we navigate uncharted waters, I urge you to stand with Taiwan in the pursuit of digital resilience. We must tap into our collective intelligence, innovation, and determination to effect real and lasting change.

TTC, under the supervision of the Department of Digital Technology, has made great contributions to the development of telecommunications in the past two decades, from code-carrying services, testing technology to policy think tanks.</p>

<p>In recent years, TTC has fully invested in the development of information security protection and achieved fruitful results. It also makes us think about expanding the “Telecom” in the English name to “Trustworthy Technology Center (Trustworthy Technology Center)”. In line with its core business of helping to strengthen digital resilience.</p>

<p>The “Drone Information Security Joint Test Laboratory” officially established on March 1st, assisted by the National Science Council and jointly built by TTC and industry partners, has set an important record for “Trust Tech” milestone.</p>

<p>UAVs can break through terrain restrictions, and have become an important auxiliary tool from agricultural and forestry surveys to disaster relief. Therefore, the government continues to develop plans for the development of the UAV industry, and combines the energy of industry, government, academia and research to establish the “Taiwan UAV Alliance.”</p>

<p>However, cases of unmanned aerial vehicles being used for attacks and surveillance by some interested people have been heard so far. It has not only become a new information security challenge, but also an important national security issue.</p>

<p>In January of this year, the Joint Test Laboratory, which is still in the preparatory stage, announced the “UAV Security Specifications” based on the opinions of experts and industry representatives from all walks of life. The content covers the three core testing items of the laboratory, including Manufacturer information security maturity, product information security, and site information security.</p>

<p>Taking the first item of manufacturer information security maturity as an example, it is like providing a “security design blueprint” so that the industry can follow clear requirements. The laboratory will check the development process, supply chain, and software and hardware bill of materials management security to ensure the security of the drone development environment and correctly introduce security into product functions.</p>

<p>The second product information security can be regarded as a “health check” for drones. The laboratory is like a health examination center, like providing health examination packages with different safety levels for drones. The higher the number of detection levels that can pass, the more complete the security protection will be. In addition to providing health checks for drones, the laboratory will also analyze problems and produce a complete report for industry reference.</p>

<p>In addition, the third field information security is to strengthen the protection of the UAV activity field to avoid being affected by the environment and other equipment, such as interference during data transmission. Just like in addition to excellent health checkups, we must also pay attention to external risk factors. Only by maintaining a good living environment and diet can we truly ensure our health.</p>

<p>Therefore, the laboratory will also follow the “Guidelines for the Evaluation of Internet of Things Field Information Security Protection” announced by the Taiwan Information and Communications Industry Standards Association, through the processes of threat modeling, vulnerability detection, penetration testing, and impact analysis. Suggestions for improving field information security.</p>

<p>We hope that TTC will not only assist the competent authority, the Ministry of Communications, to jointly establish domestic detection capabilities, but also be in line with international information security standards, and help the industry become a new force in the global drone industry. The Department of Digital Technology and TTC will continue to uphold the spirit of trust in technology to ensure information security that is “easy to defend, hard to attack, tough and reliable”.</p>]]></content><author><name>唐鳳、彭筱婷</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="韌性建設" /><category term="資通安全" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The joint testing laboratory has set an important milestone for "Trust Technology".]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/drone-ttc.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/drone-ttc.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">T-Road and Zero Trust</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="T-Road and Zero Trust" /><published>2023-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Taiwan’s first dedicated cybersecurity administrative body, the <a href="https://www.nics.nat.gov.tw/?lang=en">National Institute of Cybersecurity</a> (NICS), was officially established, adding a strong force to the Ministry of Digital Affairs. About the same time, the Ministry of the Interior also revised the <a href="https://www.moi.gov.tw/news_content.aspx?n=145&amp;s=274867">Regulation for Applying for Provision of Household Registration Information and Related Information by Various Agencies.</a>”.</p>

<p>These two events seem unrelated, but in fact, they mark a new chapter in the concept of “cybersecurity equals national security.”</p>

<p>Given that data exchange methods such as CDs and flash drives are easily replicated, lost, or untraceable, the Ministry of the Interior stopped providing household registration data to applying units through these methods since the end of last year. This means that any agency applying to access household registration data can only do so through the government’s Internet Service Network (GSN).</p>

<p>Based on the experience of the Ministry of the Interior, all public agencies that involve national personal information will introduce the “Interagency Data Transmission Exclusive Channel” (T-Road) within the next two years. T-Road transmission is encrypted with agency certificates and is not connected to external service, providing more stringent cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Based on this foundation, our next focus policy is to integrate the “Zero Trust” system with the T-Road network transmission management system and fully introduce it into public agencies with the highest level of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The traditional cybersecurity framework is based on the distinction between internal and external network permissions, protected by a firewall. The most common approach is that administrators must enter the internal network and input an account password to log into the back end.</p>

<p>However, relying only on the firewall and password for protection is like relying on a single anti-theft door and password lock for an entire building. No matter how stringent the security measures are, if someone intends to steal, they can use the password and pass the security to enter each floor and move freely in each room, causing serious consequences.</p>

<p>The core concept of “Zero Trust” is “Never Trust, Continuously Verify”: anyone, anywhere, at any time, must undergo three verifications of identity, equipment, and behavior patterns when entering any room, even the head of the agency. This way, even if the attacker sneaks into the lobby, they cannot obtain other data because the three verifications at each door are not the same.</p>

<p>From these characteristics, it can be seen that for information systems that require a large amount of transmission and frequent interaction with other units, Zero Trust can prevent malicious actors from stealing data at both ends of the transmission. The complete identity verification trail and undeniable transmission record can more effectively detect insider theft.</p>

<p>T-Road provides a leak-proof secure channel, and “Zero Trust” fills in the gap of a stringent gatekeeping mechanism. Therefore, starting from the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ MyData platform, the T-Road management system will fully introduce the Zero Trust system with three verifications by the end of this year. The Cybersecurity Institute, which broadens the recruitment of cybersecurity professionals and effectively integrates industrial, academic, and research resources, is the project partner to assist various agencies in introducing Zero Trust systems.</p>

<p>In addition to assisting various agencies to strengthen cybersecurity measures, the NICS will also use public code to develop common systems and assist various departments in joint defense against major cybersecurity incidents. Starting from the “Never Trust, Continuously Verify” Zero Trust framework, we aim to create a “Never Stop, Continuously Improve” national digital resilience.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Service" /><category term="Cyber Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Triple verification of identity, equipment, and behavior patterns, even the head of the agency.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/security-2168233_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/security-2168233_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The era of password-free login has arrived</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The era of password-free login has arrived" /><published>2023-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86/"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the new year, we have great news to share with you all: starting this January, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has officially become a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international standard organization. This not only breaks through the past constraint of only being able to join international organizations as a private entity, but it is also a milestone toward the vision of “Plurality”.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Ministry has also joined the FIDO Alliance, which develops and promotes secure and convenient identity standards, becoming the second Taiwanese government unit to become a member after the Ministry of the Interior joined in 2021.</p>

<p>Thanks to the standards set by W3C, websites can be properly displayed on every device, be it a phone, tablet, or computer. In other words, without these standards, even if you have the device, you may not be able to read the website’s content. This means no more seamless streaming, online shopping, or any activity through websites. Its importance to the world is evident.</p>

<p>However, if you want to further interact with other people through the website, such as making videos and publishing articles, you almost always need to register and upload information first. However, account information on a single website often cannot be shared and circulated among different platforms. This not only leads to the monopoly of a few large cross-border platforms, but also limits everyone’s independent right to use data.</p>

<p>Therefore, many communities have developed their own “code portability” solutions, so that everyone can freely choose the most suitable creative environment, fully exercise their data rights, and create more exciting works together. However, there must be a global technical specification to make these solutions truly interoperable with each other.</p>

<p>So in July 2022, W3C launched a brand-new decentralized identity verification standard (DIDs), allowing us to see the dawn of a new generation of digital services. This set of standards allows everyone to directly verify each other’s identities without going through an intermediary service.</p>

<p>We might as well think of this identity mark as an “Internet Passport”. This passport allows everyone to carry their own digital assets; whether it is social posts, photos or videos, it is no longer the cross-border platform that controls these contents, but returns to each creator himself.</p>

<p>If W3C proposes a set of standards for verifying passports, allowing everyone to have their own digital identities; then the FIDO Alliance is responsible for ensuring the security of this passport.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance, established in 2013, is an international non-profit organization jointly established by the information industry. Their original intention is to solve the problem of authentication identity. In the past, when logging in to website services, you had to type in your password, which was not only difficult to save, but also faced risks such as account theft and identity fraudulent use.</p>

<p>Therefore, the FIDO Alliance formulated the standard of “password-free login”, and developed various passports for W3C, plus security locks and keys. In this way, everyone can use their passports more safely to roam in the Internet space.</p>

<p>As a member of two major international organizations, the Ministry of Digital Affairs will participate in the formulation of standards according to the needs of all walks of life in Taiwan, and synchronize with the world, and immediately introduce these emerging standards into government agencies, civil society and the industry to practice Plurality – collaborative diversity.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Democracy Network" /><category term="Digital Industries" /><category term="Cyber Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Participate in the formulation of standards and interoperate with the world.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/blockchain-3513216_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/blockchain-3513216_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Send noodle online cloud</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%80%81%E9%BA%B5%E7%B7%9A%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Send noodle online cloud" /><published>2022-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%80%81%E9%BA%B5%E7%B7%9A%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%80%81%E9%BA%B5%E7%B7%9A%E4%B8%8A%E9%9B%B2%E7%AB%AF/"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, my colleagues from the Industrial Development Administration and I went to the oil depot in Banqiao to learn about the application of the <a href="https://www.tcloud.gov.tw/">Taiwan Cloud Market</a> platform . The store has been in business for 36 years. From roadside stalls to storefronts, it is already a time-honored snack bar in Banqiao. The steaming noodles and the sweet and plump oysters are impressive.</p>

<p>The boss said that they usually start preparing materials at six o’clock in the morning, and then open the store from nine thirty in the morning until seven o’clock in the evening. Even if there is an endless stream of customers, the well-trained clerks keep the queue from stagnating. From ordering to checkout, the meal can be served in an average of five minutes.</p>

<p>However, at the same time, the clerks are still overwhelmed with various customized needs such as on-site ordering and delivery, answering reservation calls, confirming takeaway orders, and “no coriander”. Recording and verbal transmission using only pen and paper is time-consuming and error-prone.</p>

<p>This problem has found an effective solution through the “Taiwan Cloud Market” platform promoted by the Digital Industry Agency of the Ministry of Digital Affairs.</p>

<p>“Taiwan Cloud Bazaar” integrates cross-agency processes such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and selects various cloud tools and services suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises into a single platform.</p>

<p>As long as it meets the certification standards of small and medium-sized enterprises, or is a profit-making enterprise with tax registration, in just ten minutes, all procedures such as application, review and signing can be completed on the cloud market website, and the digital transformation plan can be directly purchased. You can also get up to 30,000 yuan in digital point subsidies. If you don’t know how to choose the right solution, there are also expert consultants online to provide assistance.</p>

<p>Through the cloud market, Youkukou Noodle Shop adopts the “Quicker Line Ordering Customer Service System” to provide customers with 24-hour online ordering and online payment.</p>

<p>Through digital operation, the clerk no longer needs to answer the phone, and the verbal confirmation time of about three minutes is eliminated for each order. Moreover, because of the online ordering system, it has reached a wider customer base and increased the consumption of online group buying, and the average unit price of each customer has increased by at least two times. In addition, through data collection, it is also helpful for raw material management, making the purchase cost more accurate.</p>

<p>From the story of Youkukou noodle shop, we can see that the cloud service with open subscription system and transferable data is an important digital transformation tool for SME partners. Therefore, in addition to helping more business partners introduce cloud solutions through the cloud market, we also encourage service providers to continue to innovate through the “Digital Cloud Service Thematic R&amp;D Subsidy Program” and develop simple and easy-to-use cloud solutions for all walks of life. plan.</p>

<p>At present, “Taiwan Cloud Market” has collected 15 types of cloud solutions such as online store opening, marketing promotion, remote office, enterprise management, customer service, and market analysis. As of November this year, there have been more than 15 cloud solutions Thirty-six thousand companies use it.</p>

<p>All walks of life have different operating objectives. The Digital Department continues to assist everyone in finding suitable digital tools and cloud services, so that all kinds of carefully crafted services and products can be delivered to customers easily and simply.</p>]]></content><author><name>唐鳳、彭筱婷</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="數位產業" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA["Taiwan Cloud Marketplace" has been used by more than 36,000 companies.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/digitization-7580781_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/digitization-7580781_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Made in Taiwan Reliable and Reliable</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E8%A3%BD%E9%80%A0-%E4%BF%A1%E8%B3%B4%E5%8F%AF%E9%9D%A0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Made in Taiwan Reliable and Reliable" /><published>2022-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E8%A3%BD%E9%80%A0-%E4%BF%A1%E8%B3%B4%E5%8F%AF%E9%9D%A0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E8%A3%BD%E9%80%A0-%E4%BF%A1%E8%B3%B4%E5%8F%AF%E9%9D%A0/"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr visited Taiwan for the first time. When visiting the Ministry of Digital Technology, he pointed out that Taiwan is a reliable economic and national security partner, and he very much looks forward to the deepening of cooperation between the two sides in matters related to information security.</p>

<p>Commissioner Karl’s statement has its own reasons. Taiwan has become the world leader in semiconductor and information and communication manufacturing, and has the most complete industrial supply chain in the world. And we are at the forefront of overseas cyber attacks, and we have rich practical experience in information security.</p>

<p>With the recent rapid changes in the international situation, governments of various countries are paying more and more attention to the security risks of technology products. For example, the United Kingdom announced that it will completely remove Huawei’s 5G products by 2027. Therefore, the digital department will integrate “industrial information security” and “information security industry” to create a reliable supply chain.</p>

<p>In terms of strengthening industrial information security, in January this year, the world’s first semiconductor information security standard “SEMI E187” jointly created by Taiwan’s industry, government, academia and research circles was officially released. Is the device secure. In order to help more operators to use it, practical operation guidelines were also released in October to guide the industry in evaluating whether the product complies with the regulations.</p>

<p>In addition, in the past, Chinese manufacturers could only send chips to foreign laboratories for safety testing. If the inspection failed, the industry had to modify the product before sending it for inspection, resulting in high costs.</p>

<p>Now, the “Chip Security Joint Testing Laboratory” is jointly established by the Ministry of Digital Industry, the academic community and the industry, providing local testing for the industry to enter the international market at a lower cost and faster.</p>

<p>From these experiences, it can be seen that information security is already a necessary investment in semiconductors and even all walks of life; Taiwan began to promote the “six core strategic industries” two years ago, including the excellent information security industry.</p>

<p>In recent years, Taiwan’s new information security enterprises have also made significant progress in “quality” and “quantity”. Up to now, 28 information security innovations have been established, among which Laiyi Digital and Boou Technology have also won the In the past two years, he has won the first prize in the field of network security of SelectUSA, an investment summit in the United States.</p>

<p>As a digital “coach” for various industries, the Ministry of Digital Industry has also built Taiwan’s first information security practice base “Shalun Information Security Service Base” to help strengthen industrial information security and promote the information security industry.</p>

<p>The information security base simulated and designed twelve sets of attack scenarios based on information security incidents at home and abroad. In response to these scenarios, we have also cooperated with domestic information security companies to develop defensive countermeasures. The team can not only use it to participate in the actual test, grasp the advantages and disadvantages of their own products, but also learn more about suitable solutions.</p>

<p>In other words, the information security service base is not only a training ground for information security manufacturers, but also a platform for matching supply and demand and gathering business opportunities in the information security industry.</p>

<p>Made in Taiwan (MIT) has always been a quality assurance. Today, T not only represents Taiwan, but also means trustworthiness. By strengthening industrial information security and developing the information security industry, the Digital Division will let the world see: “Made in Taiwan means trust and reliability.”</p>]]></content><author><name>唐鳳、彭筱婷</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="數位產業" /><category term="資通安全" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[MIT has always been a guarantee of quality.
