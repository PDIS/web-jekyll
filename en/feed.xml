The reason? A dramatic increase in machine-generated entries as a byproduct of the popularization of generative AI. The irony of AI-generated sci-fi and an overwhelmed editorial staff is no laughing matter — it reveals deep-seated concerns held by many.</p>

<p>The multifaceted capabilities of AI services extend to translation, art, coding and even inspiration, making them indispensable in numerous sectors. Yet, the “Clarkesworld” response is a mere symptom of the societal impact of AI. Even more concerning is the ability of AI to replicate faces and voices, leading to sophisticated fraud and eroding the bedrock of interpersonal trust. When weaponized by totalitarian regimes and cybercriminals, this poses a severe threat to democratic systems.</p>

<p>On top of these concerns, the most sophisticated generative AIs are each trained by a single organization. This leads to a one-size-fits-all model unintentionally echoing the biases of its creators. As a result, the diverse cultural nuances of a global audience are frequently neglected or mishandled.</p>

<p>At London Tech Week, which I attended at the invitation of the organizers in June, a cross-sector consensus emerged from intense discussions on such issues: The future of AI must avoid centralization and instead adopt a diverse democratic model. To maintain a delicate balance between the advancement of AI and safety, we need to move away from placing unwavering trust in a handful of developers. Instead, we must provide channels for <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/20/why-picking-citizens-at-random-best-way-to-govern-ai-revolution-tech-politics/">citizens across the world</a> to participate and collaboratively build a globally trusted AI assurance framework, hallmarked by shared ethical standards and usage principles.</p>

<p>During these dialogues, I reflected on one of my favorite sci-fi novellas, “The Lifecycle of Software Objects” by the tremendous Ted Chiang. The narrative features a future tech firm merging AI and VR to create virtual life forms. Two of the protagonists come to understand that AI, like a living organism, requires continual nurturing and education to evolve.</p>

<p>“Experience is algorithmically incompressible,” Chiang writes, reflecting on the process of raising virtual life. “If you want to create the common sense that comes from twenty years of being in the world, you need to devote twenty years to the task.”</p>

<p>This simple but profound insight provides a roadmap for AI democratization: Sustainable consensus can only be achieved through public participation. This is why I joined the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP), alongside industry partners such as OpenAI and Anthropic, in launching Alignment Assemblies. Taiwan is setting a global precedent in <a href="https://talk.polis.tw/">aligning AI values</a> through civic deliberation, in what we term an “<a href="https://ideathon.tw/polis">ideathon</a>.”</p>

<p>“The Lifecycle of Software Objects” ends with the AI entities exhibiting independent thought, emotional intelligence and deep social connections due to the protagonists’ steadfast patience. I envision the future of AI, starting with pioneering Alignment Assemblies, to mirror this evolution. Let’s draw upon the rich tapestry of diverse experiences and the “<a href="https://cip.org/research/democratizing-ai">wisdom of crowds</a>” accumulated over thousands of years, and shape AI into trusted and wise partners dedicated to societal well-being.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng, Gisele Chou</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Strategy" /><category term="Democracy Network" /><category term="Cyber Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you want to create the common sense that comes from twenty years of being in the world, you need to devote twenty years to the task.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/20230803.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/20230803.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Public-Private Collaboration for Precise Fraud Prevention</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E7%A7%81%E8%81%AF%E9%98%B2-%E7%B2%BE%E6%BA%96%E6%89%93%E8%A9%90/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Public-Private Collaboration for Precise Fraud Prevention" /><published>2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E7%A7%81%E8%81%AF%E9%98%B2-%E7%B2%BE%E6%BA%96%E6%89%93%E8%A9%90</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E7%A7%81%E8%81%AF%E9%98%B2-%E7%B2%BE%E6%BA%96%E6%89%93%E8%A9%90/"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, the Executive Yuan ratified the “Fraud Action Program 1.5” and established the “Fraud Prevention Office”. Concurrently, I received requests from my column readers, hoping I would share the concrete actions of the digital department in combating fraud.</p>

<p>In reality, fraud doesn’t just affect governance and economy, but its more severe consequence lies in the erosion of societal trust.</p>

<p>Should government units be impersonated by wrongdoers, crucial messages would fail to reach the public effectively; if e-commerce platforms are counterfeited, consumers would find it hard to trust, thereby reducing their willingness to purchase.</p>

<p>To combat fraud, the first step is to block the source of fraud and prevent personal information from being stolen. Consequently, the digital department is fully committed to promoting “Short Code SMS” and privacy-enhancing technologies, to assist industries in enhancing information security and reducing personal data leaks.</p>

<p>With numerous text messages received on mobile phones daily, how does one discern the genuine messages? The Ministry of Digital Affairs has designed a government-specific SMS short code for this very purpose. This set of numbers can only be used by government agencies for text messages. We anticipate its launch in the fourth quarter of this year, enabling everyone to distinguish it clearly and prevent counterfeit attempts by criminals.</p>

<p>Just like the anti-fraud hotline “165” and other government-exclusive numbers, they are easy to remember and can’t be altered. Upon determining this set of short codes, the digital department will liaise with telecom operators for preemptive technical checks.</p>

<p>Moreover, we are encouraging e-commerce partners to implement privacy-enhancing technologies, replacing the recipient’s contact number on the order with representative numbers and codes. Logistics personnel can contact the recipient by simply dialing the code, and the public can also contact logistics using this code. It’s not only convenient and memorable but can also prevent personal information leaks.</p>

<p>The second step in combating fraud is to prevent fraud at its end, even if personal information is unfortunately leaked, and to inhibit the flow of money. This is the “platform joint defense” implemented by the Digital Department.</p>

<p>The e-commerce anti-fraud collaborative platform was jointly established by the Ministry of Digital Affairs, industry associations, and Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC). Once an e-commerce partner identifies a fraudulent website and reports it to 165, the Taiwan Network Center can quickly halt the analysis of fraudulent domain names, minimizing the risk of domestic users being deceived, using the Public Association as a liaison.</p>

<p>The game point fraud collaborative platform was co-established by the Digital Department, the Procuratorate, the Executive Yuan’s Money Laundering Prevention Office, and the game point industry. It offers services like “game entry delay of forty-eight hours”, and “point anti-fraud lock card platform”. When the public discovers they have been deceived, they can lock it on the platform and return to the original store for a refund, thereby reducing losses.</p>

<p>From March this year until now, the card lock platform has successfully locked hundreds of transactions, and the number of reported incidents has been reduced from 1,500 per month to fewer than 100.</p>

<p>The public-private collaboration mechanism promoted by the Digital Department is also applied to virtual accounts. Should a bank discover an illegal virtual account, it can report to the Financial Supervisory Commission through the collaborative platform, and then the digital department will perform inspections according to law. For illegal cash flows, we cooperate with the Financial Supervisory Commission to establish a third-party payment inquiry system, helping relevant units obtain the necessary account information in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The goal of the digital department in combating fraud is to build a resilient protective net, not just fixing leaks at the end but also blocking them from the source. We will continue sharing specific methods and execution results, and we welcome readers to offer their opinions to improve our policy.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Industries" /><category term="Digital Service" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not just fixing leaks at the end but also blocking them from the source.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/hands-1947915_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/hands-1947915_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A phone call at 3,000 meters</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E9%80%9A%E6%A8%99%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%83%E5%85%AC%E5%B0%BA%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A phone call at 3,000 meters" /><published>2023-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E9%80%9A%E6%A8%99%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%83%E5%85%AC%E5%B0%BA%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E9%80%9A%E6%A8%99%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%83%E5%85%AC%E5%B0%BA%E7%9A%84%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1/"><![CDATA[<p>In the ever-changing world of the internet, “instant reading” and “instant replies” are behaviors that many people take for granted. However, the colleagues in the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) must regularly make “one-minute phone calls” that can only be hung up at the last second.</p>

<p>This one-minute phone call is an important step to ensure the quality of communication everywhere. When the inspection staff arrives on site, the engineer will connect and capture the signal of the nearest base station, then connect to the operator’s system end, conduct a hundred reaction tests, and confirm that the network is smooth. The last phone call must last for one minute without interruption. Both the network and voice calls must meet the standard to pass the test.</p>

<p>Compared to the inspection completed within ten minutes, what is more time-consuming is to reach the inspection point. In May, colleagues from the moda and various telecommunications operators went to the 99 Mountain Villa on the top of Daba Peak, the Zhongba Mountain House at an altitude of 3,300 meters, and the Cuifeng Mountain House on Taiping Mountain to conduct forest communication measurements.</p>

<p>These long journeys are not only to provide hikers and tourists with fast and convenient communication quality, but also to enhance the digital resilience of various places and solve life problems through the internet.</p>

<p>For example, Taiwan is full of high mountains and vast territories. If there is an emergency medical need in the mountains, it is often restricted by transportation and affects medical treatment. Therefore, the moda supports telecommunications operators to develop 5G remote diagnosis and treatment platforms, which can transmit medical images in real time and allow specialist doctors to read them remotely.</p>

<p>Take the example of Ren’ai Township in Nantou County, where many tribes are deep in the mountains. The doctor of the health center can let the dermatologist see the patient’s lesions from a distance through video, making the diagnosis more accurate. This system has been used in twelve counties and cities and thirty-five townships, serving more than 30,000 people.</p>

<p>This method of “replacing roads with the internet” effectively meets life needs and is the original intention of the moda to continue promoting 5G applications. Therefore, we focus on “reducing costs”, “opening applications”, and “simplifying procedures” as the core, and officially open the application of 5G dedicated frequency dedicated network in June.</p>

<p>In order to encourage more industries to use it, the Administration for Digital Industries has formed a promotion group with thirteen public associations, including tourism, cultural performances, livelihood and manufacturing, etc., to propose industry blueprints for dedicated frequency dedicated network services and application solutions, and continue to participate in and support innovative applications.</p>

<p>For example, the immersive experience version of the Bell Ringing Drama Troupe “VALO Trilogy-Island” is supported by the Digital Department, telecommunications operators, and the Institute for Information Industry, allowing the four-story space of the National Theater to be filled with 5G signals and control 1,200 light source carriers. After the audience wears a 5G bracelet, they can be in the same fantasy world as the dancers and interact in real time.</p>

<p>This approach showcases the characteristics of 5G’s broad connectivity and low latency. The setup of more than a thousand signals not only ensures coverage in every corner of the venue but also significantly reduces the network connection delay time from an average of one second to 0.1 second. This allows the live performance and the audio-visual experience to be perfectly combined.</p>

<p>From one-minute phone calls to low-latency rates of 0.1 seconds, we continue to improve network quality. This allows 5G applications to become a helpful tool for everyday life and a new driving force for industries to move forward.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Communications and Cyber Resilience" /><category term="Resource Management" /><category term="Digital Industries" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5G remote diagnosis and treatment platforms can transmit medical images in real time.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/nature-g62a81da2f_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/nature-g62a81da2f_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital public infrastructure, shared by all</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD-%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital public infrastructure, shared by all" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD%EF%BC%8C%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%BB%BA%E8%A8%AD-%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB/"><![CDATA[<p>Alain Richard, Vice President of the French Senate, led the Senate Friendship Group to Taiwan to visit the Digital Department at the end of April. Members of the French political parties are most curious about how to design a system to smoothly promote digital services? I said that this is the result of long-term accumulation of inter-ministerial committees. The current “universal cash for all people” is the best example.</p>

<p>Public cash policy is based on triple- and quintuple-stimulus vouchers. Take the collection channel as an example. After the digital voucher is used up, you can choose to receive cash. At that time, only some banks’ automatic teller machines (ATM) supported it. This time we have promoted more banks to join, covering more than 80% of the country, serving more than 4 million people, and receiving 6,000 yuan directly at ATMs.</p>

<p>For friends who are inconvenient to collect in person, you can also register online on the official website, and let the cash be directly transferred to your account. The “children’s family epidemic prevention subsidy” system established in 2021 can not only ensure the guardianship relationship between the child and the recipient, but also allow the recipient to decide which account to remit to. Become the core structure of this popularization of gold.</p>

<p>Before the system was launched, the colleagues of the National Information Security Research Institute have comprehensively detected the weaknesses of information security, ensured that the entire transmission process is encrypted, and access to data must be authorized and recorded. Personal information is not only strictly protected, but will also be deleted one month after the completion of the project.</p>

<p>The targets of this issuance include foreign nationals holding permanent residence permits. Therefore, the Pufa Cash website is set up in a bilingual structure to avoid obstacles caused by language skills; Conforms to the AA level specification of the accessibility mark.</p>

<p>These practices not only make the website easier to use, but also take care of the needs of people with disabilities. Even if people access the system with their mobile phones during their busy commuting, they can still experience a clear, easy-to-understand and error-free usage process.</p>

<p>The smooth general distribution has come to an end, how to properly use this mechanism that combines identity verification, information flow, and cash flow in the future? We plan to expand this mechanism into “digital public construction” and provide it to government agencies at all levels for distribution operations; based on the spirit of public code, we will also provide value-added use of codes to various agencies to speed up system construction efficiency.</p>

<p>In addition, we will also import “T-Road cross-organization data transmission exclusive channel”, the whole process is encrypted with agency certificates, and will not be connected to external service network segments. Normally, the transmission interface is closed through T-Road, and the T-Road interface transmission can only be activated after the distribution operation is started and the competent authority and the personal information agency confirm the scope of access. In this way, agencies at all levels can ensure the security of personal information when performing distribution operations in the future.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the number of general cash recipients has exceeded 20 million, of which more than 9 million people have received online through the official website. The Ministry of Digital Affairs will continue to collaborate with various ministries to create more labor-saving and safe public programs, so that the public can obtain convenient services in multiple ways.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Service" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to properly use this mechanism that combines identity verification, information flow, and cash flow in the future?]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/technology-5348129_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/technology-5348129_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Informed Data Governance, Rational Data Altruism</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Informed Data Governance, Rational Data Altruism" /><published>2023-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%B2%BB%E7%90%86%E6%9C%89%E6%99%BA-%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86/"><![CDATA[<p>This book is the crystallization of wisdom jointly created by academics and practitioners in the field of digital governance, following the publication of “Government Digital Transformation: An Essential Guide”. This time, the authors focus on “government data governance”, once again demonstrating their profound professional expertise.</p>

<p>If digital transformation is likened to the Industrial Revolution, data is the new energy driving the wheels of the times. Just as the development and utilization of energy are vital to the success of industries, data governance is the cornerstone of digital transformation.</p>

<p>Today, with the popularization of audiovisual and language models, businesses ranging from translation, customer service, marketing, and content creation are all impacted by generative technologies. Just like advancement of refining technology has liberated fossil fuels from primitive uses such as lighting and heating — not only producing powerful propulsion for land, sea, and air vehicles but also generating countless plastic products, permeating every aspect of food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment — the prevalence of foundation models spurs global investment in data applications, unleashing boundless creativity.</p>

<p>However, just as petrochemical products have triggered climate crises and ecological disasters, leading to the pursuit of clean energy as a century-long challenge, foundation models are closely related to large datasets from training to application. If there is no foundation for proper governance, cyber-ecological disasters are imminent, with deepfake scams being just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the international community is paying close attention to governance issues, expecting legal, ethical, and technological advancements to proceed hand in hand. At the G7 Digital and Technology Ministers’ Meeting held in Japan in late April, a joint statement was issued, pledging to promote “human-centric” principles to maximize benefits for all and oppose misuse and abuse that undermines democracy, freedom, and human rights. The statement echoes the spirit of the “Declaration of the Summit for Democracy” and the “Declaration for the Future of Internet”, pointing out that a “Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT)” mechanism is the top priority for cross-border collaboration.</p>

<p>In other words, in the face of rapidly developing technologies such as foundation models, even if there are concerns about harms to human rights and democratic values, “free flow” remains the primary value of cross-border data governance, rather than building isolated strongholds or resorting to government regulation to reject data flow, turning advanced countries into “prohibition-first” countries.</p>

<p>The five principles put forward in the statement — “rule of law”, “due process”, “democracy”, “respect for human rights” and “harnessing the opportunities of innovation” — can be summed up as “human centric”, firmly defending the value and protection of individuals as data subjects. Just like the well-known fable, if governments cannot sincerely face the lost iron axe, they will not be rewarded with golden and silver axes.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs was established in response to public expectations, with the mission of “government digital services, data governance, and open data”. As a supplement to legal and ethical norms, we promote Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and actively assist e-commerce and logistics companies in adopting them to reduce the risk of personal data breaches.</p>

<p>Observing international trends, the European Union recently advocated privacy-enhancing processing, proactively transforming high-value data into non-personal data, promoting applications across various sectors for public benefit.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, public-benefit applications such as climate and environment, disaster prevention and rescue, transportation, health care, energy management, and social assistance all have corresponding “high-value” topics on the data.gov.tw platform, inspiring endless innovative solutions. Over the past decade, the platform has attracted 113 million views and over 19 million downloads, and through events like the “Presidential Hackathon”, it inspired a myriad of practical co-creations.</p>

<p>In other words, the “oil analogy” mentioned in this book may only be half right; oil and minerals are rival goods, but data is quite the opposite, possessing “non-exclusivity” and “non-competitiveness”. Under a governance environment built on sound legal systems and privacy-enhancing technologies, data can exhibit “anti-rival good” characteristics: the more it is shared, the greater its value, contributing to both individuals and the world.</p>

<p>That is to say, only in an environment of free flow with trust can the “data altruism” concept proposed by the European Union’s Data Governance Act (DGA) be realized: data holders voluntarily provide data to drive societal development and improve public service quality.</p>

<p>As foundation models become popular, the vision of “data democratization” in Chapter 10 of this book is about to be realized, with everyone expected to become a producer and user, and “data governance” becoming a core issue in digital development. The publication of this book will undoubtedly guide all sectors to achieve informed and rational data governance. Only by pooling the collective intelligence can we establish mutual connections, foster virtuous collaborations toward the common good, and realize “data altruism” in a rational and principled fashion.

<p>Over the years, numerous creative applications that address social issues have emerged from the foundation of open data. For example, innovative ideas, such as an irrigation system that combines rainwater warnings and a smart system designed to help farmers and fishermen cultivate clams, have been proposed by contestants in data application competitions in recent years.</p>

<p>The key to the success of these ideas lies in the continuous release of various types of high impact data by government agencies.</p>

<p>In the past, high impact data with significant public value, such as meteorological observations and disaster relief resources, often faced legal and computational constraints, preventing their easy release. Over the past decade, the government has persevered in overcoming these challenges to provide data for public use.</p>

<p>For instance, the Central Weather Bureau’s “Meteorological Resources Innovation Application Plan,” announced in 2022, opened up access to high-precision meteorological data and resources for legal entities and businesses. This not only improves the accuracy of weather forecasts but also enables the development of targeted meteorological and ocean current analyses for industries like fisheries and shipping.</p>

<p>This case study demonstrates the potential for high-value application data to connect different industries and professions. After soliciting opinions from various ministries and the public, the Digital Ministry has established a “High Application Value Thematic Area” on the Government Open Data Platform.</p>

<p>Departing from the previous classification based on industry or agency, we now categorize data based on “themes” according to social value and content. Initially, six data sets were classified: climate and environment, disaster prevention and rescue, transportation, health and medical care, energy management, and social assistance. Theme-based planning not only aids in data search but also reveals the connections between different data sets, stimulating further collaboration.</p>

<p>For example, the “climate and environment” dataset can contribute to the net-zero transition. The goal of “net-zero” is to minimize human-induced greenhouse gas emissions while offsetting them through negative emissions technologies and forest carbon sinks. In line with the 2021 United Nations Glasgow Climate Agreement, Taiwan proposed a “2050 Net-Zero Emissions Pathway” in March last year and officially implemented the “Climate Change Response Act” this year.</p>

<p>The theme of this year’s Presidential Hackathon International Track, “#FreeTheFuture: Open, Digital &amp; Green,” combines democratic communication, data application, and net-zero carbon emissions, presenting an excellent opportunity for interdisciplinary data sharing and use.</p>

<p>Earth’s natural resources, often depleted due to human over-exploitation, are considered competitive assets, leaving less for future generations. In contrast, open data serves as an “anti-rival good,” where sharing increases its value and contributes to both individuals and the world.</p>

<p>The Digital Ministry will continue to promote the opening and application of data for public good, assisting in the sustainable use of scarce global resources, and welcoming more friends to join our ranks.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Plural Innovation" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data for public good assists the sustainable use of scarce global resources.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/earth-gab4518d56_1920.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/earth-gab4518d56_1920.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Summit for Democracy: Shaping emerging technologies to align with human rights and democratic principles</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summit for Democracy: Shaping emerging technologies to align with human rights and democratic principles" /><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83-%E5%BD%A2%E5%A1%91%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BB%A5%E7%A2%BA%E4%BF%9D%E5%B0%8A%E9%87%8D%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%8A%E8%88%87%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87/"><![CDATA[<p>Good local time, everyone. I’m Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s digital minister.</p>

<p>It is a genuine honor to participate in the second Summit for Democracy. I will share Taiwan’s experiences in tackling common challenges facing our free and open societies and how emerging technologies strengthen human rights and democratic principles.</p>

<p>Since the inaugural Summit for Democracy in December 2021, the world has fundamentally changed. Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has sent shockwaves throughout the international community.</p>

<p>As democracies adapt to this reality, Taiwan shines brightly as a trustworthy and most reliable partner in promoting digital resilience. During the darkest days of COVID-19, our industries rose to the challenge, becoming a potent producer of essential medical supplies. Our civic technology supported the emergence of the Taiwan Can Help model in a global counter-pandemic coalition.</p>

<p>Based on this rock-solid foundation of collaboration, I signed the Declaration for the Future of the Internet in 2022, along with 60 partner countries. The declaration cemented our shared values and
deepened our commitment to democratic allies, paving the way to free the future in the digital realm together.</p>

<p>At the heart of this vision is the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda), and its objective of “digital resilience for all.” This comprises three levels: Emergency, industrial, and societal resilience.</p>

<p>Emergency resilience impels us to effectively respond to various crises, including cyberattacks and natural disasters. Recent incidents, such as those during the former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s historic visit to Taiwan, unsuccessfully attempted to undermine public trust in our democratic system.</p>

<p>To counter emerging threats, including AI-powered interactive deep fakes, we are consolidating public and private cybersecurity capabilities,
implementing zero-trust principles, and conducting exercises to ensure the seamless operation of critical infrastructure during emergencies.</p>

<p>Starting this year, we’re integrating new satellite providers, enabling multiple networks to reinforce one another across land, sea, and air in times of crisis. The moda website uses IPFS, an emerging technology
for censorship resistance, so everyone can donate connectivity to back us up, while also supporting journalists in autocracies so their reportage remains tamper-free.</p>

<p>Industrial resilience is our commitment to facilitating digital transformation across all sectors while fostering a robust ecosystem. Taiwan possesses a highly advanced IT industry with a world-class semiconductor supply chain and a wealth of experience neutralizing cyberthreats. With global standards such as SEMI E187, we
elevate the Made in Taiwan brand to represent a guarantee of integrity and a solid shield to our democratic partners.</p>

<p>Societal resilience focuses on empowering our civil society by connecting to the democracy network. The moda initiated the Digital News Co-prosperity dialogues with global platforms and brought together the Ministry of Culture, National Communications Commission, and Fair Trade Commission to explore ways of fostering mutually beneficial cooperation with Taiwan’s print, broadcast, and digital journalists.</p>

<p>We believe that accurate news reporting is the bedrock of democracy, and digital competence requires a well-informed and discerning citizenry. In the face of authoritarian expansionism, democracies must confront formidable challenges undermining the delicate equilibrium between societal well-being and individual freedoms. Our efforts must go beyond devising protective measures — we’re envisioning a trajectory embracing the triad of participation, progress, and safety through the power of collective intelligence.</p>

<p>This approach is embodied in the moda’s overarching vision: Plurality, or collaborative diversity. When people from all walks of life can form
digital public spaces together, we can empower the voices reaching across ideological divides and uncover our shared values in plain sight.</p>

<p>As we navigate uncharted waters, I urge you to stand with Taiwan in the pursuit of digital resilience. We must tap into our collective intelligence, innovation, and determination to effect real and lasting change. Let’s embark on this journey and show the world the indomitable spirit of democracy — together.</p>

<p>Thank you. Live long and … prosper.</p>

TTC, under the supervision of the Department of Digital Technology, has made great contributions to the development of telecommunications in the past two decades, from code-carrying services, testing technology to policy think tanks.</p>

<p>In recent years, TTC has fully invested in the development of information security protection and achieved fruitful results. It also makes us think about expanding the “Telecom” in the English name to “Trustworthy Technology Center (Trustworthy Technology Center)”. In line with its core business of helping to strengthen digital resilience.</p>

<p>The “Drone Information Security Joint Test Laboratory” officially established on March 1st, assisted by the National Science Council and jointly built by TTC and industry partners, has set an important record for “Trust Tech” milestone.</p>

<p>UAVs can break through terrain restrictions, and have become an important auxiliary tool from agricultural and forestry surveys to disaster relief. Therefore, the government continues to develop plans for the development of the UAV industry, and combines the energy of industry, government, academia and research to establish the “Taiwan UAV Alliance.”</p>

<p>However, cases of unmanned aerial vehicles being used for attacks and surveillance by some interested people have been heard so far. It has not only become a new information security challenge, but also an important national security issue.</p>

<p>In January of this year, the Joint Test Laboratory, which is still in the preparatory stage, announced the “UAV Security Specifications” based on the opinions of experts and industry representatives from all walks of life. The content covers the three core testing items of the laboratory, including Manufacturer information security maturity, product information security, and site information security.</p>

<p>Taking the first item of manufacturer information security maturity as an example, it is like providing a “security design blueprint” so that the industry can follow clear requirements. The laboratory will check the development process, supply chain, and software and hardware bill of materials management security to ensure the security of the drone development environment and correctly introduce security into product functions.</p>

<p>The second product information security can be regarded as a “health check” for drones. The laboratory is like a health examination center, like providing health examination packages with different safety levels for drones. The higher the number of detection levels that can pass, the more complete the security protection will be. In addition to providing health checks for drones, the laboratory will also analyze problems and produce a complete report for industry reference.</p>

<p>In addition, the third field information security is to strengthen the protection of the UAV activity field to avoid being affected by the environment and other equipment, such as interference during data transmission. Just like in addition to excellent health checkups, we must also pay attention to external risk factors. Only by maintaining a good living environment and diet can we truly ensure our health.</p>

<p>Therefore, the laboratory will also follow the “Guidelines for the Evaluation of Internet of Things Field Information Security Protection” announced by the Taiwan Information and Communications Industry Standards Association, through the processes of threat modeling, vulnerability detection, penetration testing, and impact analysis. Suggestions for improving field information security.</p>

<p>We hope that TTC will not only assist the competent authority, the Ministry of Communications, to jointly establish domestic detection capabilities, but also be in line with international information security standards, and help the industry become a new force in the global drone industry. The Department of Digital Technology and TTC will continue to uphold the spirit of trust in technology to ensure information security that is “easy to defend, hard to attack, tough and reliable”.</p>]]></content><author><name>唐鳳、彭筱婷</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="韌性建設" /><category term="資通安全" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The joint testing laboratory has set an important milestone for "Trust Technology".]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/drone-ttc.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/drone-ttc.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">T-Road and Zero Trust</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="T-Road and Zero Trust" /><published>2023-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/T-Road-%E8%88%87%E9%9B%B6%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Taiwan’s first dedicated cybersecurity administrative body, the <a href="https://www.nics.nat.gov.tw/?lang=en">National Institute of Cybersecurity</a> (NICS), was officially established, adding a strong force to the Ministry of Digital Affairs. About the same time, the Ministry of the Interior also revised the <a href="https://www.moi.gov.tw/news_content.aspx?n=145&amp;s=274867">Regulation for Applying for Provision of Household Registration Information and Related Information by Various Agencies.</a>”.</p>

<p>These two events seem unrelated, but in fact, they mark a new chapter in the concept of “cybersecurity equals national security.”</p>

<p>Given that data exchange methods such as CDs and flash drives are easily replicated, lost, or untraceable, the Ministry of the Interior stopped providing household registration data to applying units through these methods since the end of last year. This means that any agency applying to access household registration data can only do so through the government’s Internet Service Network (GSN).</p>

<p>Based on the experience of the Ministry of the Interior, all public agencies that involve national personal information will introduce the “Interagency Data Transmission Exclusive Channel” (T-Road) within the next two years. T-Road transmission is encrypted with agency certificates and is not connected to external service, providing more stringent cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Based on this foundation, our next focus policy is to integrate the “Zero Trust” system with the T-Road network transmission management system and fully introduce it into public agencies with the highest level of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The traditional cybersecurity framework is based on the distinction between internal and external network permissions, protected by a firewall. The most common approach is that administrators must enter the internal network and input an account password to log into the back end.</p>

<p>However, relying only on the firewall and password for protection is like relying on a single anti-theft door and password lock for an entire building. No matter how stringent the security measures are, if someone intends to steal, they can use the password and pass the security to enter each floor and move freely in each room, causing serious consequences.</p>

<p>The core concept of “Zero Trust” is “Never Trust, Continuously Verify”: anyone, anywhere, at any time, must undergo three verifications of identity, equipment, and behavior patterns when entering any room, even the head of the agency. This way, even if the attacker sneaks into the lobby, they cannot obtain other data because the three verifications at each door are not the same.</p>

<p>From these characteristics, it can be seen that for information systems that require a large amount of transmission and frequent interaction with other units, Zero Trust can prevent malicious actors from stealing data at both ends of the transmission. The complete identity verification trail and undeniable transmission record can more effectively detect insider theft.</p>

<p>T-Road provides a leak-proof secure channel, and “Zero Trust” fills in the gap of a stringent gatekeeping mechanism. Therefore, starting from the Ministry of Digital Affairs’ MyData platform, the T-Road management system will fully introduce the Zero Trust system with three verifications by the end of this year. The Cybersecurity Institute, which broadens the recruitment of cybersecurity professionals and effectively integrates industrial, academic, and research resources, is the project partner to assist various agencies in introducing Zero Trust systems.</p>

<p>In addition to assisting various agencies to strengthen cybersecurity measures, the NICS will also use public code to develop common systems and assist various departments in joint defense against major cybersecurity incidents. Starting from the “Never Trust, Continuously Verify” Zero Trust framework, we aim to create a “Never Stop, Continuously Improve” national digital resilience.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Digital Service" /><category term="Cyber Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Triple verification of identity, equipment, and behavior patterns, even the head of the agency.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/security-2168233_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/security-2168233_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The era of password-free login has arrived</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The era of password-free login has arrived" /><published>2023-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E4%B8%80%E7%B5%84%E5%B8%B3%E8%99%9F%E8%B5%B0%E9%81%8D%E7%B6%B2%E8%B7%AF%E7%9A%84%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86/"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the new year, we have great news to share with you all: starting this January, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has officially become a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international standard organization. This not only breaks through the past constraint of only being able to join international organizations as a private entity, but it is also a milestone toward the vision of “Plurality”.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Ministry has also joined the FIDO Alliance, which develops and promotes secure and convenient identity standards, becoming the second Taiwanese government unit to become a member after the Ministry of the Interior joined in 2021.</p>

<p>Thanks to the standards set by W3C, websites can be properly displayed on every device, be it a phone, tablet, or computer. In other words, without these standards, even if you have the device, you may not be able to read the website’s content. This means no more seamless streaming, online shopping, or any activity through websites. Its importance to the world is evident.</p>

<p>However, if you want to further interact with other people through the website, such as making videos and publishing articles, you almost always need to register and upload information first. However, account information on a single website often cannot be shared and circulated among different platforms. This not only leads to the monopoly of a few large cross-border platforms, but also limits everyone’s independent right to use data.</p>

<p>Therefore, many communities have developed their own “code portability” solutions, so that everyone can freely choose the most suitable creative environment, fully exercise their data rights, and create more exciting works together. However, there must be a global technical specification to make these solutions truly interoperable with each other.</p>

<p>So in July 2022, W3C launched a brand-new decentralized identity verification standard (DIDs), allowing us to see the dawn of a new generation of digital services. This set of standards allows everyone to directly verify each other’s identities without going through an intermediary service.</p>

<p>We might as well think of this identity mark as an “Internet Passport”. This passport allows everyone to carry their own digital assets; whether it is social posts, photos or videos, it is no longer the cross-border platform that controls these contents, but returns to each creator himself.</p>

<p>If W3C proposes a set of standards for verifying passports, allowing everyone to have their own digital identities; then the FIDO Alliance is responsible for ensuring the security of this passport.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance, established in 2013, is an international non-profit organization jointly established by the information industry. Their original intention is to solve the problem of authentication identity. In the past, when logging in to website services, you had to type in your password, which was not only difficult to save, but also faced risks such as account theft and identity fraudulent use.</p>

<p>Therefore, the FIDO Alliance formulated the standard of “password-free login”, and developed various passports for W3C, plus security locks and keys. In this way, everyone can use their passports more safely to roam in the Internet space.</p>

<p>As a member of two major international organizations, the Ministry of Digital Affairs will participate in the formulation of standards according to the needs of all walks of life in Taiwan, and synchronize with the world, and immediately introduce these emerging standards into government agencies, civil society and the industry to practice Plurality – collaborative diversity.</p>]]></content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Democracy Network" /><category term="Digital Industries" /><category term="Cyber Security" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Participate in the formulation of standards and interoperate with the world.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/blockchain-3513216_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/blockchain-3513216_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
