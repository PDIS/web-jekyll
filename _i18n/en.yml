        #### Virtual Reality

        The face-to-face review is inevitably causing confusion due to the large number of people. Virtual reality allows participants to be in a digital environment and provides more technical support to participants. Take a look at the film shot by Tang Feng and experience the application of virtual reality in civic participation.

        #### ORID

        ORID (Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional) is one of the ways in which structured dialogue is ideally led by the facilitator. By guiding the objective facts, subjective feelings, thoughts and decisions of a particular subject, the participants are naturally guided to reach a consensus. In the face of more complex topics, this approach is often used to construct conversations that help the meeting discuss and focus on key issues.

        #### Commercial Origami

        Business Origami is the method invented by the Hitachi Design Center. Commercial origami uses paper-cutting as a symbol of people, groups, communication channels, and the environment to create miniature models of the system. Paper-cutting is placed on a whiteboard or large paper, drawing system elements in different areas, and interactions and information flows between the elements.

        #### Kanban

        Kanban is a production scheduling control tool developed by Toyota industrial engineer Taiichi Ohno to control the supply chain to increase production efficiency. Today, Kanban has become an effective tool for managing projects, especially for projects with outputs and targets. Trello is an online version of Kanban for project management.

        #### Sandstorm

        [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) is a website productivity set that you can set up yourself. We set up Sandstorm within the government network and use it with other public officials. Sandstorm is a convenient online platform with collaborative applications or tools such as shared files, shared folders, instant messaging systems, charting tools, and more. We also offer new Sandstorm applications such as the collaborative spreadsheet [EtherCalc](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0) and bookmarks [Linksholder](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/upcmp5j10r4x8j7kdfram8xx41ujvqjw0hq8ed2y72hky552znk0).

        #### OKR

        Objectives and Key Results (OKR) are effective systems for goal management, which are used to set and communicate goals and outcomes in an organization. OKR's primary goal is to combine company, team or individual goals with measurable results so that work can move in the right direction. Currently, the PDIS team uses [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) as the back end for OKR.

        #### Persona

        Personas are personal images of fictional realities that describe a particular group of subjects. By drawing the behaviors, actions, and preferences of this character and similar people into "personal characters," you can understand the group with this persona. The character of the character is displayed in the way of establishing a character, and the character of the character is not lost.
        Such role-playing helps ensure that work is always focused on the user, not an abstract description of their respective groups.

        #### User Journey

        User Journeys is the process of showing how people interact with services step by step. Through the user experience journey, the work team can identify problem points in the service process to confirm which parts of the new ideas can be improved.

  what:
    title: What is open government?
    content0: The open government was proposed by an international organization called the OGP (Open Government Partnership).
    content1: 「......Adhering to open value and engaging with citizens to improve services, manage public resources, drive innovation and build safer communities. With the principle of transparency and open government, we will achieve prosperity, well-being and a society in line with human dignity in our own country and in an increasingly connected world.......」
    content2: The four visions of an open government—the future we look forward to—are transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion.

  why:
    title: Why should there be an open government?
    content: "The higher the trust base is between the public sector and the public, the better the chance for sound public policies. Vice versa: A lack of mutual trust can lead to a loss of focus of discussion and public policy wobbles, with huge social costs. Therefore, <a class=\"text-highlight\">the mutual trust between the public sector and the public is the ultimate goal of an open government.</a>"

  how:
    title: How to promote an open government?
    content: <a class="text-highlight">To promote open government, we must start by changing the culture of public service. </a> If civil servants who are actually driving the policy can be the locomotive and take the initiative to adopt more open methods and thinking to produce policies, over the term, the policy can take the right direction as soon as possible, and it can also help accomplish things better. In other words, changing the culture of public service is like sewer engineering, which, while invisible, must make significant change over the long run.

  who:
    title: Who will advocate for an open government?
    content: An open government is everyone's business, so we need people who are willing to participate in the policy drive process, the civil servants who can share practical experiences, and the administrative officers who can take the lead on accountability; So the "open government contact" appointed by the ministries, or PO (Participation Officer), is the "seed" of changing the culture of public service and fertilizing deeply open government.

  points:
    title: The four elements of an open government
    content: What is an open government? To put it simply, in the process of making public policies, the four elements of transparency, participation, accountability, and inclusion are gradually fused. That is the way to implement an open government. But specifically, what should be done?
    list:
      - title: Transparency
        img: Transparency.png
        content: Politics is everyone's business, and the policy process should allow the public to have a clear understanding of "what's going on." Friends in the public sector may be worried whether there will be any problems if we let the outside world see the communications before it's finished. In fact, the earlier the information is provided, the easier it is for the public to understand what the public sector is preparing for, so that the public sector can save the effort and time of repeated communication and further reduce the communication burden.
      - title: Participation
        img: Participation.png
        content: In the process of policy formation, the public is given the opportunity to participate in discussions, express opinions, and even further influence the content of policy on topics of interest. As a result, while the public sector needs to spend more time building consensus, when the policy takes shape, it is less likely to be opposed by the public or totally objected.
      - title: Accountability
        img: Accountability.png
        content: When the public has doubts about the process of policy formation, we can look back to see who does and what are the reasons
      - title: Inclusion
        img: Inclusion.png
        content: Public issues are broadly oriented. In the course of discussion of an issue, if the public sector is able to allow the various stakeholders who are directly affected by policy to fully voice their views and able to listen to their dialogues, it can collect as many views as possible so as to reduce the likelihood of policy errors.
    summary: The above mentioned four elements shall be linked together in order to achieve the vision of an open government. If there is only transparency, but no accountability, or if there is participation without inclusion, serious problems will arise. There is only a superficial openness, but no spirit of openness. It will become an "open washing."
