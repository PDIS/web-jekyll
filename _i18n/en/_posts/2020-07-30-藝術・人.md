🏆 After the baptism of popular vote and two collaborative workshops, a total of 24 teams entered the re-election in this year’s President’s Cup hackathon. After the re-election meeting on July 13, 10 teams have been selected Baked. 

🎨 Each team that enters the re-election is extremely ingenious and practical. Even if it is not selected, it is an expected social innovation proposal. Among them, what impressed me the most was the construction of a &quot;cultural habitat&quot; for the visually impaired. 

🕶️ The concept of cultural habitat comes from the personal experience of team members. As a civil servant in charge of cultural business, Xie Siying once saw a visually impaired friend in an art gallery before he could participate in a dedicated commentary, so she could barely use the audio guide. However, the general audio guide is mostly to supplement background knowledge. It is difficult for visually impaired friends to experience the visual content, nor can they understand the whole exhibition. 

😎 Therefore, Xie Siying took the initiative to propose a hackathon for the President&#39;s Cup, hoping to integrate the inter-library collections of various museums and establish a complete resource library for oral images. Through event matchmaking and friend recommendations, the team has successively joined partners including front-end and back-end engineers, UI &amp; UX, and system analysts to create the prototype of &quot;Art For All&quot;. 

🗣️ In just nine weeks from proposal to review, they used a lot of research, market analysis, and interviews with visually impaired people and related experts to create a website prototype that can fully operate the front and back ends. The special feature of &quot;Art For All&quot; is not only a mobile art system for visually impaired friends and disadvantaged partners, but also allows the general public to conduct online curation through the open collection of resources. At present, they have successively negotiated with Pu Tiansheng Sculpture Memorial Hall and other institutions to help build a database of oral images. 

💬 The same social innovation with the core concept of &quot;Museum Cultural Equality&quot; is the &quot;Spiritual Exhibition&quot; of the Forbidden City exhibited at the C-LAB (Taiwan Contemporary Culture Experimental Ground). The Spiritual Exhibition is jointly curated by the Forbidden City and Cifang Care Center. It uses cultural relics as a medium, and through the joint creation of contemporary artists and Cifang members, the audience rethinks the daily life of the mentally handicapped. A few days ago, the Palace Museum also actively contacted the PDIS team of the Executive Yuan to hold a workshop and invite interested parties to join the creative process to understand the relationship between cultural relics and friends with disabilities. These attempts have received great response. 

🎁 The results of the first wave of &quot;Art FUN Coupons&quot; last week allowed the arts and literature circles to formally gain substantial support from 2.1 million friends. The cultural habitat and spiritual exhibition demonstrate to us how &quot;art combined with social innovation&quot; can open up new possibilities for the lives of different friends. And friends like me who did not win the &quot;Art FUN Voucher&quot; still have many channels to do their best for beautiful things.
