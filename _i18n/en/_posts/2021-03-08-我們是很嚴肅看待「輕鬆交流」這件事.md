Previously, the open government liaisons (PO) of various ministries and conferences participated in the "Consensus Camp" held by PDIS every year. This year, let's make friends first. 

The goal of the PO Consensus Camp is always quite "greedy": First, let the PO be familiar with the spiritual principles of open government and the actual case flesh and blood through the consensus camp like a class: Next, let the PO Being able to participate in the planning and operation of the system illustrates the long-term observation, feedback and reform policy of PDIS, and the PO has the opportunity to understand the context and give feedback. Finally, take advantage of the annual gathering so that the PO can truly become a "PO Network" to establish mutual assistance. Network, exchange friendship. 

In the public service system, through the exchange of friendship and trust between people, can it finally promote the gap between inter-departmental cooperation and bureaucratic regulation under various conditions such as mechanism design? 

I don’t know, it sounds difficult to practice, nor easy to verify, but we have to give it a try. Separate the variable of "Communication and Friendship" to see if we have put too many elements in the past, which makes this variable useless. 

 That afternoon, we chose to host the Social Innovation Experimental Center, which is airy, bright, and unrestrained. It is a very different place from the usual meeting of the Executive Yuan. Tang Feng walked out of the office, gave a speech casually, the new PO introduced herself, and then started a chat. 

What to talk about? There are no designated topics, no posters and post-it notes, no "discussion on the host/table manager", only the "stand owner" placed beforehand, which is performed by a senior and experienced PO, and the task is only "to let everyone chat together." 

Before the event, of course, we had to talk to the stall owners, and we also got feedback, "The new PO meeting should be confused! Let PDIS take a class first, at least know how to ask questions."

 In a pre-conference meeting, only a brand-new PO is used to "class", the boring system and terms are introduced, and the rest will wait until the exchange meeting, where the old and new PO will naturally ferment. 

On the day of the exchange meeting, the new PO stood up and introduced themselves one by one. A colleague said, "I am glad I was not "requested", but "invited" to come." There was finally laughter. 

The key words in the heart of civil servants are broken, and there is a little possibility of relaxation. 

Whether they are assigned to serve as PO or have different degrees of free will, and come to this place, in short, everyone as public servants is the same with legal norms and responsibilities. We know this very well. 

So we sent an official document from the hospital to ask everyone to come, send an email to the meeting notice, make a sign-in form and a name tag. 

But, sit in the booth and decide for yourself what you want to talk about, what questions you want to ask, and what you want to talk about. Sit down somewhere you like! If no one orders the table, PDIS will not intervene in your communication time. 

We will set up for everyone in silence, maintain a basic rhythm of the program, take pictures, prepare refreshments, and finally use strawberry cake as an inducement, please leave it to the end to take a group photo with us, that's it. 

What I want to promote here is not that Part A will meet with Part B, nor are it tasks or topics, but only "people" and "people". Although PDIS usually cooperates fully with everyone, and even makes everyone feel exhausted. At least today, we take "easy communication" seriously.
