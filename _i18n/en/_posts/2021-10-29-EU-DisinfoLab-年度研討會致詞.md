In a modern society where social media and Internet technology are booming, false information spreads like a virus. For a diversified democratic country like Taiwan, the challenge of false information is extremely complex, because anyone with a mobile phone and basic editing tools can participate in the dissemination of false information. 

Before the 2020 pandemic, Taiwan was recognized as the country most attacked by false information. Most of these attacks come from China, and their motives are obvious: to shake our democratic, social and government mechanisms in order to carry out its authoritarianism. 

For example, during the anti-transmission movement in Hong Kong, a message circulated in Taiwan's social media, trying to portray the Hong Kong Chen Kang masses as "thugs" who paid 20 million yuan to kill the police. Of course, this is a serious smear of Chen Kang's masses, and its intention is well known to passers-by: to reduce the impact of the anti-transmission movement on Taiwan's presidential election. In fact, this message is only circulated in Taiwan’s social media, because Hong Kong people can easily see through this false message, so its target audience is obviously not Hong Kong. 

According to the "Taiwan Fact-Checking Center", this message can be traced back to the WeChat official account of "Chang'an Sword", which is the official WeChat official account of the "Central Political and Legal Committee" of the Communist Party of China. They distorted Reuters photos and fabricated original messages in an attempt to portray the teenagers who participated in Chen Kang as buying iPhones and participating in violent actions. Based on these images, someone then created an argument to support this statement. This wrong message obviously came from the Chinese Communist regime. 

Taiwan faces such false information attacks day after day. The epidemic has exacerbated this trend. It is believed that about 20% of the false information related to the epidemic comes from China. 

As the epidemic rages around the world, anxiety has ignited a prairie fire of false information-we have seen that false information related to the epidemic has brought many challenges, and eventually led to the so-called "information epidemic" of the "World Health Organization" (WHO) ( infodemic). 

Taiwan does not adopt a centralized approach, but uses a decentralized and people-oriented approach to combat the ongoing "message epidemic." I summed up Taiwan’s response to the epidemic as "fast, fair, and fun" (fast, fair, and fun). We use the "humor over rumor" method to combat false news about new coronary pneumonia, and make the public laugh at the false information. 

Let me illustrate with an interesting example. In Taiwan, we have a very cute Shiba Inu. It is called "Zong Chai". It is the "spoke dog" of our Central Epidemic Command Center. It is responsible for using cute dog pictures to promote the information released by the Command Center. For example, in order to promote social distancing, we use pictures to tell the public: "Please keep the distance between two Shiba Inu indoors, and keep the distance between three Shiba Inu outdoors."

In Go (2020) 2 In May, there is another example showing how we use "viral" humor, not only to preach the correct message, but also to combat false messages, which can be said to be "the way of the person, and the body of the person." . 

At that time, we saw false information circulating on the Internet, claiming that Taiwan's increase in mask production would crowd out the capacity of toilet paper. Therefore, we made Dean Su Zhenchang into a slogan, using the funny way of "No matter how you know the hip, we only have one Cachen" to urge the public not to stock up toilet paper. "). I also don’t forget to attach a form to the map, stating that the raw materials of toilet paper are imported from South America and have nothing to do with the production of masks, because the raw materials of the masks are produced in Taiwan. 

The rationale behind this strategy is very simple: the method that starts with speech censorship will only be met with overwhelming resistance, because in a pluralistic democratic country, pre-censorship by the government is absolutely unworkable. Yes, so we must think of innovative ways to stay ahead of conspiracy theorists and disinformation attacks. 

This is not easy, because most false messages are motivated by anger, and anger is the most viral emotion. Anger leads to revenge, discrimination, and even hate speech, which makes the people's emotions insensitive. When the public began to unconsciously share information, the "message epidemic" began to spread. Therefore, we must administer a "vaccine" against the "spiritual virus" such as conspiracy theories or false messages. We found that the "spread rate" of humor is very high, even faster than anger, and Taiwan also provides a very effective empirical evidence. So far, we have successfully contained the "message epidemic" without resorting to prior review or forced removal. 

I think that if the public has the ability to think critically and creatively, false information will not trigger anger. This is the same as biological diversity-if there is enough biological diversity in the ecosystem, the virus will be unsustainable. Democracy is the same. 

In Taiwan, we value "media literacy" more than "media literacy". The so-called "reading" is from the perspective of readers or information consumers; and "literacy" is from the perspective of producers and co-creators, that is, managers of information, data, and media. 

The Taiwanese government incorporates media literacy into basic education, not just basic education, but also basic training for the government and educators. For example, the Ministry of Education has established a media literacy education promotion meeting, and consultation meetings are held every four months to review and plan various media literacy education policies. 

We have also gradually implemented the relevant core literacy in the twelve-year national basic education syllabus and included them in various training and cultivation workshops for education and government personnel. 

What we are looking for is not a standard answer-style media education system, but to make media production and news operation a part of lifelong learning, so that the public can be aware of being news contributors. Compared with the censorship and news removal methods, I believe that this method is the long-term solution, and it can also be said to be a "vaccine" against the disinformation crisis. 

Taiwan’s resolute fight against false information on the Internet is rooted in the fact that Taiwan is one of the most open societies in Asia, and we attach great importance to freedom of speech: in Taiwan, freedom of speech is a bargaining chip that cannot be exchanged in any way. right. 

Even in the face of the global epidemic, Taiwan still ranks No. 1 in the world in the latest "Freedom on the Net 2021" report published by Freedom House in September this year. 5. No. 1 in Asia. I believe this is because we have a thriving Internet environment, meaningful and reasonably priced broadband connections, and an independent judicial system that protects free speech. The Taiwanese government also strives to make our systems and policies as transparent as possible to the people. 

Similarly, when talking about the issue of "breaking counterfeiting", we believe that centralized and opaque methods are not the most reliable. We promote fact-checking and clarification through public-private collaboration to avoid further dissemination of false information. We have established a government mechanism that can provide immediate and effective clarification, as well as a neutral and independent third-party fact-checking and media self-discipline mechanism. 

For example, the "g0v zero-time government" community has constructed a "true and false Cofacts" return mechanism, opening up mass collaboration. Other mechanisms include expert consultation models. For example, the "Taiwan Fact-Checking Center" has become a third-party fact-checking center certified by the International Fact-Checking Coalition (IFCN) in November 2018. 

In some ways, false information is only a superficial symptom. It not only comes from the lack of mutual trust between the people, but also from the lack of mutual trust between the government and the people. 

In Taiwan, we deeply embrace democracy, humanity, openness and freedom of speech. As long as we master these core values, we can create a friendly environment that is conducive to the wisdom of the masses and social innovation. We know that with the joint efforts of inter-departmental efforts, we can strengthen transparency and make the rate of dissemination of scientific knowledge higher than conspiracy theories and innuendo. 

Finally, I am very grateful to EU DisinfoLab for the invitation. I believe that this seminar will have lively and interesting discussions and bring meaningful and concrete results.
