 Innovation and digital transformation are the two most important trends of our time. From the global epidemic to Ukraine's war of aggression against Russia, the world is facing many unprecedented challenges, and it is urgent to break away from existing thinking. 
 
However, when everyone encounters a moment of exhaustion and lack of creativity, where can feasible solutions be found? Our office and the young partners of the newly established international audio and video streaming platform TaiwanPlus have jointly created a new possibility: the new audio and video podcast program "#InnoMinds Tang Fengyi Innovation". 
 
After months of collaborative planning, #InnoMinds, an idea that challenges the existing framework, is ready to go. The guests of the first season of the program include more than a dozen entrepreneurs from home and abroad, heavyweight leaders of public affairs, social science and technology experts, etc., and will share their most inspiring ideas and thinking with the world in the program. 
 
As the host and a partner of deep thinking, I will discuss the topics of social innovation, youth participation and open government together with the guests. The first season of #InnoMinds will include YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, U.S. Congressman Ro Connor Khanna) and AIT Director Sandra Oudkirk. 
 
In the first episode, Chen Shijun will take us to understand the behind-the-scenes process of YouTube's founding, and also share the short story of his first upload of the video. He also talks about why he decided to move to Taiwan, and how he sees it, if his kids want to be YouTubers? These are the wonderful stories he shared publicly for the first time on the show. 
 
 I sincerely hope that #InnoMinds can help Taiwan to go global, and let us share these precious experiences with the world. I believe that the warm, positive and progressive dialogue will inspire more abundant and endless insights and innovations for the new generation of friends. 
 
 Personally, #InnoMinds means a lot to me too. This is the first time in my life that I have participated in a Podcast program and acted as a host, and it is also the first time that TaiwanPlus has developed this type of program. We also cooperated with the Taiwan Living Aesthetics Art Foundation and selected the "Sound Lab" in the "Contemporary Cultural Experiment Center C-Lab" of the Air Force General Administration. team" concept. 
 
TaiwanPlus was established and launched last August, which opened a window for global partners to know Taiwan and learn about this hopeful land of freedom and democracy. The first season of #InnoMinds will be available from May 6, with one episode per week, with Chinese and English subtitles to choose from. 

See you at TaiwanPlus!
