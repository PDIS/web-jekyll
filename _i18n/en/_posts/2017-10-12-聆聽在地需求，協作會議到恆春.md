#### Interviews with the parties, seeing the causes behind the appeals

After the discussion with the speaker (attachment) and the discussion of the inter-ministerial meeting, it was discovered that the proposal of the proposer is not a real problem. Root, but one of the possible solutions. The reason why they asked the Airline Corps to enter Hengchun Airport is that they hope to solve the problem of excessive medical evacuation, Hengchun Airport becoming a mosquito airport, and the inability to extend the expressway. Therefore, this appeal reflects It is the problem of inadequate local medical resources and infrastructure. Since it is found that if the proponent&#39;s appeal is to be fundamentally resolved, it must proceed from the real core cause. Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior refocuses on the proposer&#39;s core demands through many inter-ministerial consultations. Finally, the Ministry of the Interior responded to the four claims of the proponents on the Join platform; the Ministry of Health and Welfare will continue to strengthen local medical quality in terms of insufficient local medical resources; and will continue to research and add additional air referral mechanisms.

The Ministry of Interior PO said that from the handling of this issue, it can be seen that the appeal of the people at the beginning was to hope that the air station was stationed at Hengchun Airport. Therefore, the Ministry of the Interior was the main responsibility, but after discussion, it was discovered that the people’s demands were only solutions. one. Returning to the problem of insufficient basic medical resources, the role of the Department of Health and Welfare is relatively important. 

#### Leaving Taipei, making distance no longer an obstacle

This is also the first time I left Taipei to go to a local conference. The PO of the Ministry of Interior observed that when Tang Feng gave a speech, he mentioned that &quot;Hengchun is a bit like an island in the island&quot;, which immediately resonated and became a lot [reported](http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/2116499)The common title for {:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. The Ministry of the Interior PO believes that to go to the local meeting for collaborative meetings, you can use the people close to the local people to share the demands of the people, not just from the perspective of Taipei; further hope that the distance should not become a hindrance to the participation of local residents. 

This collaborative meeting was held in a two-seat venue. The first venue was organized by relevant ministries, rapporteurs and stakeholders. However, due to the limited capacity of the venue, the second venue was broadcast live. The way of a meeting situation, the people who care about this topic can see the situation of the first venue collaboration meeting, and also through sli.do, so that the second meeting people and online participants can return to the first venue, let The first venue can go smoothly.

#### Mutual trust is the foundation of the open government

The Ministry of the Interior PO pointed out that this collaborative meeting still has some parts that need to be worked hard, for example, if the inter-departmental coordination time is earlier, there will be More time to prepare; should also ask the relevant authorities to assist in-depth understanding of the opinions of the presenters and interested parties as soon as possible. Do not ask the Ministry of Health and Welfare to understand the opinions of the local medical institutions as it is until the eve of the meeting. In addition, because there is no re-emphasis on the mechanism for follow-up feedback, the sponsors, the local councillors, and others will go up again with the political commissar after the meeting. 

The Ministry of the Interior PO shares, the collaborative meeting is only the starting point, the important thing is how the relevant results of the collaborative meeting can be incorporated into the policy process, whether it is planning, execution or any stage, can make the collaborative meeting more meaningful. In fact, government departments often face conflicts between responsibility, response and accountability. It may be better to achieve a better balance through collaborative meetings. 

However, &quot;Everything is still based on trust.&quot; The Ministry of the Interior PO said that not only do people have to trust the government, but the government also needs to trust people&#39;s ability to participate. Under the basis of mutual trust, rational arguments can be made to make policies more it is good.
