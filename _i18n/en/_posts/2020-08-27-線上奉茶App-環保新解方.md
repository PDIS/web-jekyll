☀️ High temperatures have been repeated this summer, and buying drinks to quench their thirst has become a daily routine for many people. However, according to statistics, Taiwan produces as much as 1 billion bottles of bottled water each year, and the length of the bottled water together can circle the earth 5.7 times. Even though the recycling rate of Taiwan PET bottles is as high as 95%, the unrecycled 5% will still cause serious environmental pollution. 

♻️ Among the final selection team of this year's Presidential Cup Hackathon, the "CircuPlus Action for Tea" team combined the culture of serving tea and the participation of the masses, and proposed a plastic reduction action plan that impressed me. 

🍵 The founder of the team Huang Weicheng said that when he joined the beach cleaning operation a few years ago, seeing the endless plastic bottles on the beach, he couldn't help but start thinking: How can we break the habit of "buying water and drinking"? Huang Weicheng remembered the tradition of serving tea. Free tea can be seen in temples and on the roadside, which is a demonstration of the Taiwanese taste. 

📲 Huang Weicheng and his friends decided to develop the "Fengcha" App to build a drinking water map across Taiwan. If you can quench your thirst without buying water, people with environmental protection concepts must be willing to join. However, in the initial stage of the implementation, due to insufficient team manpower, it was not possible to fully collect information on drinking water stations. In addition to the epidemic this year, many drinking water stations were temporarily suspended, which made the data collection inaccurate and the promotion was once not as expected. 

🎉 The Fengcha team signed up for the President's Cup Hackathon in February this year, and the problem was solved. 

🗂 Through the President's Cup hackathon, the Fengcha team and the Environmental Protection Agency are connected and collaborative. Adhering to the government's spirit of opening up information, the Environmental Protection Agency immediately coordinated with the environmental protection bureaus of counties and cities to collect complete information on drinking water stations in various places, and the Fengcha team took the first step. 

📝 In addition to the existing drinking water station information, the team also started multilateral cooperation through the wisdom of the people, inviting companies, friendly stores and the general public to share drinking water station information; users can spontaneously see a new drinking station anywhere. Add "Bong Refreshment" to, or after using a certain drinking point, score and add instructions. 

🎁 In addition, "Fengcha" has different mission levels, such as drinking water every day to get 1 gold coin, or going to Dadaocheng business district to find a Fengcha shop to get 50 gold coins. These task rewards can be redeemed for free goods at partner stores. 

🚀 Through the game and giving feedback to users, we successfully increased the willingness to use, and the participants also made the data more accurate. Since its launch for half a year, "Fengcha" has accumulated more than 6,000 water receiving points and 20,000 downloads. It has also been selected as the annual outstanding team of the President's Cup Hackathon. 

🏆 In my opinion, the results of the tea service are based on meticulous public-private collaboration. The public sector has the Environmental Protection Agency, the private sector has business circle companies, App users, and all stakeholders in the society are connected to help start-up teams implement innovative environmental action plans. 

🌊 In addition to the re-control of the tea service, another team of the President’s Cup Hackathon is dedicated to improving the end-of-life waste problem. The "Broad Sea and Sky Team" initiated by the Ocean Commission uses distributed ledgers to record the process of marine waste from volunteer cleaning, recycling, factory processing, and returning to consumers. It can not only grasp the hot spots of marine waste, but also Ensure proper use of materials and fully reflect the spirit of "Salute to the Sea". 

💧 The combination of digital technology and social innovation allows the trickle energy that was originally dispersed throughout the society to flow together, allowing sustainable thinking and daily life to have the most "water" connection.
