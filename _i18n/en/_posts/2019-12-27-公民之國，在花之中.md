The term "sense of impending doom" has appeared suddenly earlier this year. It became a popular keyword right away on Taiwan's Internet. It has even been nicknamed a "mango feeling".

As Ms Chang Chuan-fen has identified in her [opening article](https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=75174), this discussion about a "sense of impending doom" reflects a collective sentiment. Many people are feeling anxious or even helpless.

Where does this "impending doom" come from? In my opinion, it mainly stems from a fear of loss.

However, our participation in the creation of democracy is our best defence. This is because the process of hand-building our democracy enables us to experience concrete implementation and gain confidence in continuous progress. At the same time, every person living in Taiwan can use their collective effort to confront the risks and challenges all democracies are facing.

"Why don't we decide Taiwan's affairs for ourselves?" This is the most direct question on the dust jacket of [this book](https://www.sanmin.com.tw/Product/index/007389883). I hope that all readers, apart from reading this book to find answers, could also actively participate in creating democratic opportunities. Even the smallest beginning may kindle the spark of a greater movement.

From its Austronesian languages to its new inhabitants, Taiwan has long been the cradle of numerous lineages and cultures since ancient times. After a few hundred years of pursuit toward democracy, it has formed a transcultural identity with civil society enshrined as its main body.

Accordingly, I would like to share a short poem to echo Mr Liu Wai-tong's [new interpretation](https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=75328) of "Mínguó" — a country based on participatory democracy:

> Swirling ocean, beautiful islands:
> A transcultural republic of citizens.
>
> 婆娑之洋，美麗之島；
> 公民之國，在花之中。
