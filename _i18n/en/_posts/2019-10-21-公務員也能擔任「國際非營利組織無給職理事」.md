🗳️ At the end of the National Day holiday, I was in Osaka, Japan, attending Devcon, a conference initiated to improve community governance and research new features. Vitalik Buterin, who is a member on the RadicalxChange Foundation Council, and also the founder of Ethereum shared with us his experience with "Quadratic Voting" in the Presidential Hackathon.

📜 Some readers may have never heard of Ethereum or Vitalik. But that doesn't matter — the focus of this article is to share my legal basis for serving on two nonprofit organizations , as something every civil servant can reference: RadicalxChange in the United States, and the Digital Future Society in Spain.

⚖️ First, according to Article 14(1), Article 14-2(1), and Article 14-3 of the Civil Service Act, a civil servant, stipulated by the law, may not concurrently hold a public employment or business; in the case of adjunct businesses or positions for nonprofit organizations, whether or not they are paid, permission should be requested from the service agency. In my case, it is necessary to obtain consent from the Premier of the Executive Yuan beforehand.

🆗 As stipulated by Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the “Regulations Governing Approval for the Employment of Civil Servants at Non-Profit Enterprises or Groups with Remuneration”, if the part-time job has a negative impact on their work, damages the image of the government or civil servant, has the potential for malpractice, or is incompatible with their duty, the organization shall not grant the permission. It is worth noting that although only the "paid" part is specified here, I still consider these two "unpaid" positions with the same criteria, confirming that not only do they not have the above concerns, but also help connect domestic businesses with international businesses by seeking the approval of the Premier. Moreover, I use my time outside of work to perform these two "unpaid" positions and give priority strictly to the civil service.

🚀 In summary, considering these two "unpaid" positions, which are directly related to social innovation and open government, and with the consent from the Premier, I will continue to participate in RadicalxChange and the Digital Future Society as a member of the board. Along with the activities to increase the opportunity to promote our innovations in related fields globally, I also hope that this experience can be used as a case for other business colleagues to invoke and refer to.
