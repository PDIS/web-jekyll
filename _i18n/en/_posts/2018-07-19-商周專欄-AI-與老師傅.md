The typhoon has just passed, bringing abundant rainfall. This is the blessing of Taiwan, and there is no shortage of water in summer; however, in recent years, stable water supply has always been a challenge for Taiwan. 

🚰 You may not know that more than half of the water pipes in Taiwan are still plastic water pipes used to popularize tap water 30 years ago. These plastic pipes are limited to funds and cannot be completely replaced. As a result, the water leakage rate of the entire pipe is as high as 15%, and the water lost by the pipeline is nearly 1 billion tons per year. 

 This is a big question, is there a solution? There are indeed experts who are doing "grab the leak". Taishui's existing 80 masters carry a "leak detector" that can amplify 900 times of sound, and "listen" back and forth in the sewer. The seniors have 30 years of experience. However, 80 of them go down one by one, and they can circle around Taiwan in three years. Even if they are not sleepy, it is difficult to find new leaks in real time. 

This hot problem, I didn't expect to see the dawn of an AI technology recently. 

 At the beginning, I was in the President’s Cup hackathon. For the first time, I saw the proposal of the “Rescue Water Baby” team and found that they used the technology of “supervised learning”, which means that the trapped masters told the machine. What kind of data is heard indicates that there is a leak, and then the "deep learning" algorithm is used to predict whether the field check is correct. By the time the "machine apprentice" gradually builds the model, it can save the masters a lot of time and effort. 

🕚 Such a system is not the first invention in Taiwan, but also a solution for Israeli company developers, but it is costly. In Taiwan, the system written in open source has reached 70% accuracy, and the time it takes to find a leak source has dropped to one-tenth of the past. 

 自主 Self-developed technology has one advantage: it can be used in other fields, such as smart meters or natural gas pipelines. Because of the pressure and flow rate, this concept can also be used. The "Rescue Water Baby" team will also represent Taiwan in the next month to participate in the acceleration plan organized by the New Zealand government to provide solutions to local water leakage problems. 

 And the interesting thing about this case is that there is always a voice in the workshop: AI is coming, and human work opportunities will be replaced. 

👴 For example, the 80 masters who caught the leak, are they unemployed when AI comes? completely opposite! The process of machine learning will continue to require the wisdom of human beings to "fill in" and constantly let people learn from each other in order to solve the problem one by one. 

💡 “Rescue Water Baby” incorporates the wisdom of the master, solves the problem in collaboration, and finds new value for people. This is what we expect.
