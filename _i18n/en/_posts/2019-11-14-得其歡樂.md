🔽 "Happy Can't Party" held an inaugural meeting this afternoon. Based on the idea of promoting the communion of generations and achieving freedom and democracy with joy, I sent a pot of flowers based on catnip to show blessing and support. Twenty years ago, several young people put forward "happy hopes", trying to dilute the long-standing tragic atmosphere of democratic development, and open more exchanges and dialogues between generations and ethnic groups through different ways. Mutual understanding. The results are well known: they successfully reversed the political arena in Taipei and changed the fate of Taiwan. 

 The current social environment, including "Mango Dry", is facing various challenges. For many friends, it is necessary to be cautious and serious. There is nothing wrong with thinking like this. 

 However, Taiwan, which is brave and confident and not divided, is the premise of all answers. In other words, if we fall into internal friction and stop listening to each other, we may lose the freedom and democracy we cherish today. 

 Therefore, any way to promote dialogue and build consensus is worth more encouragement and experimentation. 

🌏 That is where you want to be.
