 🔝 As the election approaches, related discussions are getting more and more heated, and the topic of "disinformation" has once again become the focus. In April of this year, the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), a political science transnational survey project, released the latest annual database, stating that Taiwan ’s attack on overseas fake information in 2018 was “the world ’s first”, and it can be said that it is becoming imminent for us. test. 

 ✍️ How do I answer this question? In December 2018, the Executive Yuan released the "Project Report on Preventing the Harm of Fake Information". In addition to starting from itself, the government has clarified rumors in a timely manner, and more importantly, encourages major social platforms to sign "Practical Guidelines for Self-Regulatory Practices of Prevention of False Information ". 

 🔢 For example, LINE launched “[Digital Accountability Project](https://fact-checker.line.me/)” this year, and the g0v Citizen Technology Innovation Award grant team “really "Fake Cofacts." At present, there are more than 140,000 reports and more than 30,000 reports. 

 🤹 At the same time, many friends have also spontaneously invested in the ranks of preventing the harm of fake information. In May 2019, "[2020 Presidential Candidate Fact Check Plan](https://www.readr.tw/project/fact-check-2020)" was held in taipei at the zero-hour government (g0v) of the citizen technology community. The hacker Matsunaka hosted by President Kong was born. 

 🧩 This large-scale collaborative project that includes news media, online platforms, and civic communities originates from the idea of the online platform Readr team. Jian Xinchang, the team's initiator and also a senior community participant, thought at the time of participating in the hackathon: "The more the multimedia is willing to cooperate, the more chance it will be to complete the whole puzzle." So he began to inquire about the hackathon. The willingness of the local media and the community has contributed to the investment of public television P # news labs, media platforms such as Wo Cao and the citizen community. 

 🚧 This plan has several steps: first, find out the candidate's public speech video, open the netizens to make verbatim, verify, classify, and then check the content with the news media. At present, 14 media and cooperative units and nearly 1,000 netizens have joined the ranks of verbatim manuscripts and checking facts. The verification operation is still in full swing. 

 🗽 Many friends worry that fake information will mislead people to judge and change election results. In my opinion, the biggest harm of false information is actually destroying people's imagination of democracy, leading everyone to feel that democracy cannot let each other listen, let alone reach consensus. Whether it is the "LINE Information Verification" platform or the "2020 Presidential Candidate Fact Check Plan", it not only reflects the social creation spirit of "people's affairs, help from others", but also deepens democratic literacy through participation.
