In previous collaboration meetings, because the themes were mostly social issues and public policies with a certain degree of attention, the main method of collaboration was usually through the process of &quot;discussion&quot;. 

However, the 67th government collaboration meeting &quot;Forbidden City Dialogue Painting Exhibition: Dialogue and Co-creation&quot; was opened. In addition to exploring the needs of people of different identities for &quot;description cards&quot;, we spent more time on &quot;creating &quot;Experience&quot; as a collaborative method. 

This time the participants were recruited by the Forbidden City through the Internet. Several people with specific identities were designated &quot;1. Teachers and students of museum-related departments (studying and working), 2. Will take students there High school teachers visiting the Forbidden City, 3. Science and engineering, technical or scientific backgrounds/people who like to visit science museums, 4. Parents/housewives whose children are currently in elementary school, 5. Elders over 65 years old, 6. Exhibition venues or planes Design practitioners, 7. Pilgrims who must visit museums when traveling abroad.&quot;

Come to the scene, the participants actually have a better understanding of the card than the general public, because their lives and work are more relevant to the exhibition . After the guided tour, everyone can quickly dive into this topic that the general public may not be so familiar with. We also use a simple tool list to summarize different needs and correspond to different levels of opinions. 

Next, we enter the &quot;co-creation&quot; link of the main event. Instead, we ask everyone to temporarily put aside the existing knowledge, stop the expression of words, and instead watch the exhibits together, touch different things with both hands. The process of actually creating an &quot;explanation card&quot; to allow participants to experience the relationship between this &quot;item&quot; and us.

In addition to on-site improvisation, at the same time, with the unique conditions of closing the venue on the spot, participants can bring their unique instruction cards into the exhibition room and make participants more aware of the existence of the instruction cards Three-dimensional sense of space.

In the exhibition room, including lighting, showcases, moving lines, etc., as well as the physical distance between the card and the exhibits, the experience brought to the audience is somewhat different from the original feeling when creating. Listening to different participants introduce their instruction cards and explain the process of &quot;how to introduce this exhibit&quot;, which also inspired more imagination. Therefore, returning to the discussion table in the end, many people&#39;s feedback is that in this process, I can more imagine the multi-faceted consideration of the overall curatorial.

Actually, many policies, like the instruction card, need to respond to a variety of diverse needs. They take into account too many aspects and need to choose. Administrative agencies have their professional and overall considerations. When museums and curators think about an exhibition, they also have many considerations. These comprehensive designs may not completely meet the needs of users, so it is necessary to listen to the opinions of multiple parties in real time. 

However, whether the process of collaboration is through discussion and co-creation, the conclusion may be that government agencies obtain suggestions for amendments and decision-making to make governance more in line with the needs of the people, or it may be that the people better understand the practice of government operations and go back to adjust policies It is recommended to even come in to help. No one end of the voice is absolutely correct, but a partnership that trusts each other and complements each other. This is the value that an open government should reflect. 

So, after the proactive proposal of the Forbidden City PO (Open Government Liaison), we started this series of collaborative processes and made a meaningful attempt for both PDIS and the Forbidden City. Let&#39;s end with the sharing from the Forbidden City PO in the collaboration meeting that day!

&quot;Although the Forbidden City is very well-known to the public, few people have never been to the Forbidden City when they were students. But to be honest, if you don&#39;t visit the Forbidden City for a lifetime, it will not affect your daily life.
| |Even so, we still use the opportunity of this painting exhibition to exhibit many national treasure-level creations, and upgrade a non-cultural relics &quot;explanation card&quot; to the same status as the cultural relics in the exhibition. This exhibition that I have seen from when I was a child to now is a pioneering work. 

We have also successfully cooperated with PDIS, using collaborative meetings, so that everyone can speak freely and express their opinions on the instruction card. After digesting these opinions, we will use the feasible part as a reference for future curation in the courtyard, and there will be some plans that can be adopted. 

In addition, we also hope that everyone will have more confidence in the various oriented action plans promoted by Political Commissar Tang Feng. 」
