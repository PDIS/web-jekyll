 On March 27 this year, the theme of the 61st collaboration meeting was quite confusing, and it was about a regulatory notice: &quot;Food additives added to commercially available packaged edible salt products contain the natural radioactive substance potassium-40. Marking regulations &quot;

 Potassium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol K. If you add a number &quot;40&quot; after &quot;potassium&quot;, that is, search for &quot;potassium-40&quot; on the Internet as a radioactive isotope of potassium, you will find that the so-called &quot;low sodium salt&quot; is &quot;potassium chloride&quot; As an alternative component, the question arises whether the natural radioactivity of &quot;potassium-40&quot; has any effect on the human body, and whether it is necessary to mark a warning on the salt packaging. 

 In September 107, the Inspectorate made corrections to several salt products of Taiwan Salt, and requested the Ministry of Health and Welfare to set a slogan to remind the product to contain &quot;potassium-40&quot; natural radioactivity. The notice of drafting is announced on the online participation platform &quot;Public Speaking&quot;. 

 The discussion about potassium salt did not start after the supervisory authority corrected it. The FDA has faced this issue for a long time: what is natural radioactive material? Is the low sodium salt containing &quot;potassium-40&quot; really harmful to the human body? What are the good and bad effects of potassium on the human body? People with different views have their own views.

 In the past discussions, some people From the academic point of view, I am sure the benefits of potassium on the human body. I am worried that people will panic when they see the label, so they dare not eat low sodium salts, but they are not conducive to health. Some people think that as long as there is radiation, there will be certain Risk, it should not be assumed that consumers will panic, and manufacturers should be regulated to label products with natural emissions; some people think that the harm of radiation is ultimately a belief, believers are always trustworthy, unbelievers are always unbelievers, and it ’s futile to discuss more or spread knowledge; Countries and international organizations around the world do not believe that this kind of situation needs special labeling. We do not need to be alone in the world, or even run the risk of adverse foreign trade.

| The open government contact person in December last year ( Referred to as PO) [the 33rd monthly meeting](https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2019-11-05-%e9%96%8b%e6%94%be%e6%94%bf% e5% ba% 9cpo% e7% ac% ac% e4% b8% 89% e5% 8d% 81% e4% b8% 89% e6% ac% a1% e6% 9c% 88% e6% 9c% 83 # s340698) The &quot;Provisions on the Labelling of Potassium-40, a Natural Radioactive Substance Contained in Food Additives of Commercially Packaged Edible Salts&quot;, pre-announced by the Food and Drug Administration, were selected by the POs of various ministries and conferences as the theme of the 61st Open Government Collaborative Meeting. 

 This case was selected in the sparrow screen at the monthly meeting, perhaps not only because this preview has a very enthusiastic message discussion on the &quot;Public Speaking&quot; platform, but also because the Taiwanese people are very concerned about food security issues, especially Yanba is almost Everyone eats food every day. As a result, a collaborative meeting jointly prepared by the Food and Drug Administration of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the National Health Administration, the Energy Association, the Standards Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economics, and other inter-ministerial meetings was opened. 

| ### From &quot;the battle of scientific knowledge&quot; to the shift to &quot;consumer&#39;s greatest rights and interests&quot; as the core issue 

 From the perspective of media reports and public opinion, it is not difficult to find the main disputes around this topic The point is that &quot;salt is added with potassium and replaced with sodium&quot; as a kind of good starting point for Chinese people&#39;s health, and &quot;natural radioactive substances in table salt must be warned of the risk of radiation hazard.&quot; The original intention of Chinese people&#39;s health is also the same. Although there are completely different opinions on the marked positions, the two parties are not the same. 

 In the first working meeting, we convened inter-departmental colleagues and looked forward to the collaboration meeting&#39;s ability to clarify scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge refers not only to the radiation risks that are most concerned by the media, but also to the collection of knowledge in various fields such as food science, nutrition, and trade. We hope that through the design guidance and open and transparent technology that PDIS is good at, people from different positions and different viewpoints can gather together to provide a stepping stone for the discussion of related topics in the future. 

 However, we also quickly discovered in the process of interviews and data collection by the ministry that although scientific knowledge has its rigor and objectivity, people&#39;s perception of risk in different situations may be subjective and subject to social Influenced by various factors. At the same time, whether the work of popularizing science as a professional can achieve good results in a single collaborative meeting that takes into account the needs of cross-ministerial meetings, without being disturbed by the gap in the interpretation of the discourse on the meeting floor, this variable also makes us Thinking about positioning with more possibilities. 

 So, we return to the original intention of the collaborative meeting, which is from the perspective of &quot;seeking common ground while reserving differences&quot;, so that people with various roles and identities are at least willing to sit together under the basic consensus and listen to each other&#39;s concerns. 

 As mentioned above, all parties take &quot;Chinese people&#39;s health&quot; as the starting point. So, should &quot;Chinese&quot; as consumers / users / consumers of salt products also play a role in collaborative meetings? At the same time, are all stakeholders involved in this issue, including government departments, experts and scholars, enterprises and civil society groups, not all salt consumers who grew up eating salt?

 After many discussions and thoughts, we confirmed the core issue of the collaborative meeting: In response to the draft notice of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, &quot;What kind of labeling method is in the best interests of consumers?&quot; 

 It must be specifically stated that consumer interests can be Through many methods, &quot;marking&quot; is a way, &quot;not marking&quot; is also a way. &quot;Consumer&#39;s right to know&quot; is very important, but the right to know is only one of the rights and interests. Perhaps there are more rights and interests that we have not envisaged, which is the part that consumers care more about. 

 After resetting the core issues of the collaborative meeting, the organizer also stated that, in addition to the scholars and experts and group representatives involved in the case in the past, they are willing to find many people who are &quot;salt consumers&quot;. Come to the meeting, so that the discussions of each group in the collaborative meeting will ensure that the voice of the &quot;consumer&quot; is heard. 

 ### A collaboration meeting where epidemic prevention is the highest guiding principle 

 The preparation of the potassium salt case encountered an episode, which is the impact of the epidemic. The Ministry of Health and Welfare bears the brunt of the epidemic-related business. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the co-organizer, must also support related matters such as production and dispatch of epidemic prevention materials, so the collaboration meeting was postponed. As with all physical gathering activities, we have continued to follow the progress of the epidemic during the changing preparation period to ensure that the activities must comply with the guidelines of the Central Epidemic Epidemic Command Center. 

 On the day of the event, in addition to the routine amount of temperature and hand cleaning and disinfection, we also made adjustments in the venue arrangement to open the seat spacing of the participants and ensure that all participants wear masks throughout the process. Do not eat or drink in the venue. After several considerations, the group discussion meeting format was retained, and the small table leader who led the discussion also communicated first, including how to ensure that the members of the group can communicate with each other within the appropriate range, and how to guide the discussion. The limited table and chair shapes are aided by tools. Although the trust established face to face and jointly established in the place is important, it must also be weighed against the risk of infection, and explore the appropriate interaction mode in the context.

We always encourage people to pass The Internet participates in the discussion, so this case also uses live broadcast technology, with Sli.do anonymous chat room, and supplemented by [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9j_ku6qttm=/) when consolidating from the entity And opinions that come in through the internet. In the rhythm of the host, the question and answer are also conducted more efficiently, reducing the time for gathering, and avoiding the discomfort of everyone longing to wear a mask indoors. 

 Because of the diversity of participants, the heads of each group need to weigh in the discussion: will the power of discourse brought by knowledge cause some people to feel squeezed during the interaction? The PO and PDIS teams of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology, as the small table leaders to guide the discussion, can participate in the conference composed of heterogeneous participants smoothly in the state of taking into account the multiple objectives due to participating in the preparatory process and understanding the transition of the conference goals. 

 At the end of the meeting, as the political commissar said, &quot;Today, the Food and Drug Administration and relevant units are so important in the epidemic prevention task. After this meeting, there will be a meeting to open the hood 2.0. To hold such a public consultation, I feel seriously prepared Meeting materials, seriously inviting stakeholders, whether it is on-site participation, or a considerable number of friends watching the live broadcast to participate in the matter together, I think it is very sincere. &quot;Even if epidemic prevention is regarded as combat, the work of opening the government does not stop.

| ### Potassium case inspiration for the design of public consultation procedures 

 The source of this collaborative meeting is from the &quot;public lecture&quot; of the Join platform, which is the online discussion area of the regulatory notice. Unlike the public proposal, because the notice process itself is already the second half of the policy process, even when dealing with physical meetings, the discussion space will usually be narrower and closer to common administrative procedures such as public hearings and briefings. As a result, this meeting is mostly focused on ministry briefings and information clarification, but we are still constantly trying to reset the &quot;core issues&quot; to make the collaborative meeting different from public hearings and expert consultations that have been held in the past . This process highlights the value of open government &quot;public-private partnership&quot;. 

 When &quot;pick up ideas&quot; as the source of the case, our focus is easier to focus on why more than 5,000 people even signed this case? What they care about. From the perspective of &quot;public speaking&quot; as the source of the case, our focus is more likely to be on the context of the ministry&#39;s advance notice of regulations? But whether it is a little more demand from the public side or a little more demand from the government side, the &quot;collaborative meeting&quot; is a dialogue platform for the government and the people to understand each other. The core issues often need to be multi-participating, including the main co-sponsoring of the ministry, non-governmental unit stakeholders and the PDIS team in between. (Reference: [Collaborative meeting, public and private &quot;Find out the core problem&quot;](https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/zh-tw/blog/%e5%8d%94%e4%bd%9c%e6 % 9c% 83% e8% ad% b0-% e5% 85% ac% e7% a7% 81% e7% a3% a8% e5% 90% 88% e7% 9a% 84-% e6% 89% be% e5 % 87% ba% e6% a0% b8% e5% bf% 83% e5% 95% 8f% e9% a1% 8c /)) 

 The dispute of low sodium salt is based on the investigation report from the public and the supervisory institute &quot;Consumer&#39;s right to know&quot; is the initial motivation for the responsible unit to proceed from the &quot;label&quot; and a draft notice will appear, and then more voices will be exposed through the online discussion forum. &quot;No label&quot; and multiple positions and practices. When it comes to collaboration meetings, we use the broader &quot;consumer rights and interests&quot; as an entry point of view, so that we can not be limited to the right to know framework. The shaping process of this core problem can also see the traces left by different roles in the discussion of past issues. 

 When the open government work emphasizes the &quot;citizen participation&quot; aspect, it is necessary to measure the state of the policy, the nature of the issue and various objective conditions, and decide how to plan a consulting process. Sometimes a small number of stakeholders who are heavily influenced by the policy have to play a more important role; sometimes the entrance of the non-specific public can make the consultation process more legitimate; sometimes sampling based on demographic characteristics or based on interest groups The way will be considered more representative. 

 This case, from the seemingly high-threshold scientific knowledge discussion, set the target to professionals in various fields; later it became set to enter the mixed consumer as an unspecified public, and set policy Professionals and consumers are in the same field. This process of &quot;re-setting&quot; not only pushes the packaging policy of salt products further, but also adds color to our experience in jointly designing the public consultation process.
