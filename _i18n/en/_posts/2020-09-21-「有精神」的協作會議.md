## Foreword
Everyone has more or less experience with mental disorders. Maybe she/he often wanders in the community, or she/he is your friend, relative or even yourself. The general public has many stigmatized misunderstandings about this issue. We hope to share a journey of cooperation with the Forbidden City, so that everyone can understand this topic from a different perspective.

## Background Introduction
The Forbidden City has long been committed to museum cultural equality. Since 108, we have cooperated with Cifang Care Center to bring cultural relics into the care center and create together with members with mental disorders. In 109, we further planned the &quot;Enthusiastic&quot; exhibition, which included the cultural relics of the Palace Museum, artists, and people with mental disabilities. For the creation and interpretation of mental disorders. <a href="https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2020-03-02-109%E5%B9%B43%E6%9C%88%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E8%81%AF%E7%B5%A1%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E6%8E%A8%E5%8B%95%E6%9C%83%E8%AD%B0#s379433" target="_blank">The government liaison person, Yi Wen, raised this topic to the monthly meeting of open government liaison persons in March 109</a> . It is planned to hold a collaborative meeting with the Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS) of the Executive Yuan. It is hoped that the preparatory process will incorporate various opinions so that the public can have a clearer understanding of the &quot;Enlightened Exhibition&quot; and related issues. Through the open and transparent meeting mechanism and interactive workshops, more people who are concerned about this topic can also participate in discussions and express their views in another way.

## Inventory of &quot;multi-stakeholders&quot; and &quot;in-depth interviews&quot; as the first step to clarify issues 
The collaboration meeting encourages the organizing department to take inventory of interviews with multiple stakeholders, and use in-depth interviews to clarify issues and organize Different viewpoints and opinions. Min Ning and Xiulan from the Palace Museum of Education are partners with social work backgrounds. In fact, before joining the collaboration meeting, they used many open ways to invite everyone to express their views. In the process of preparing for the collaboration meeting, you can also see them Issue analysis and mastery of interviews is very high. Even so, we encourage them to use this opportunity to extend their understanding of this topic. The subjects of the final interview span the media, social workers, art, public opinion representatives and people with mental disabilities. Min Ning said: &quot;Each interview is very enlightening. It stimulates different ideas and brings the recognized issues to a higher level.&quot; One of the interviews was a member of the community dealing with the issue of mental barriers. &quot;She shared her experience in fighting for equal rights in different fields. She has been in contact with the issue of mental barriers for several years, thinking through a different perspective, extending the issue, and found that there are so many references to each other in what everyone is doing. To define the depth and breadth of this topic.&quot;
 
 
 
 
## &quot;Creation&quot; as a main axis of the collaborative meeting
The main axis clarified from the in-depth interview: &quot;Thinking about the disabled&quot; And design, let us rethink the role and positioning of collaborative meetings in such occasions. In the end, we decided to bring to the Forbidden City, an art co-creation workshop that has been implemented in Cifang for more than a year, using cultural relics as a medium to allow participants to tell their stories in a co-creation way. For one thing, we use a method that our partners will not be too unfamiliar with to get acquainted with the participants in the meeting. We also believe that creation is also a way to promote communication, hoping to use artistic creation to open a dialogue that was originally opposed or unfamiliar. This link once again echoes the mentally handicapped friends who used art to express their life stories in the &quot;Enthusiastic Exhibition&quot;. Friends with mental disorders may not be more fluent or complete in verbal communication than others. However, there are many very profound aspects in artistic presentation, which are worthy of our thinking and experience together. So we also hope that through this small link, we can let everyone present their ideas in a variety of ways. A family support police officer who participated in this collaborative meeting shared: &quot;Through today’s co-creation and dialogue, I learned more about this group of mentally handicapped friends. We also hold lectures on campus. If today’s format can be brought to campus, I believe it will help everyone understand this topic better and resolve long-standing misunderstandings.&quot;

## An &quot;equality&quot; and diverse meeting
&quot;equality&quot; is a very important part of a collaborative meeting. Like other collaborative meetings, we do not emphasize the title of the participants in the meeting . The seating arrangements are broken up, and the group composition is as diverse as possible. In the context of the mind map, we try to present all diversified topics as much as possible, and record all the on-site speeches in real time, reflecting the equal disclosure of information. The design of the topic manual and the host language of the meeting are also simplified in consideration of the difficulty of reading and understanding. In fact, the creation mentioned earlier also hopes to echo equality. Verbal expression in meetings often requires more advanced expression skills. But communication is not limited to words. We look forward to knowing each other better and promoting dialogue through creation and storytelling.

All the information produced in this conference will also be published on the Internet, reflecting the equal disclosure of information, and allowing those who wish to extend this topic in the future to leave a complete basis for discussion.

 A teacher who participated in the meeting also shared after the collaborative meeting: &quot;At the beginning of the warm-up session, the host asked everyone to introduce themselves with their favorite animals, and then use the materials on the table to create freely. The aunt cut Xu Wei Taking the old cat at home as an example, I never liked cats so much to love her so much. It’s such a gradual learning and being born out of understanding.” We hope that through this process, we will be able to bring each topic a topic. Clearer outline. I also hope that through co-creation and discussion, open a dialogue between people, even if they have been stigmatized or have made you afraid. As in every meeting we will mention: &quot;Collaborative meeting is just the beginning.&quot; Gradually learn, open up more dialogues and possibilities because of understanding.
