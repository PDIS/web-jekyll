On June 29, 2018, PDIS held the 36th Collaborative Meeting of Open Government Liaisons at the Yukong Headquarters Center to discuss the possibility of nursery centers, kindergarten installation monitors, and the reduction of teacher-student ratio. . 

This collaborative meeting was a merger of two cases. On March 15, 2018, netizen Jia He proposed on the Join platform &quot;[Please support legislation to force custody centers and kindergartens to set up an online surveillance system](https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/d4834778-78aa -4328-b2a0-bcf517880e1c)&quot;, i hope to legislate to force the nursery center and kindergarten to set up an online online surveillance system so that parents can immediately watch the child&#39;s actions. then on march 24th, netizen coral lin proposed &quot;[reducing the teacher-student ratio] in the kindergarten (https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/c42ad297-84b9-4ccd-8326-dda69e0e76f9)&quot; on the Join platform. It is required to reduce the teacher-student ratio in kindergartens and improve the quality of early childhood education. After the open government liaison voted in May, the two cases were handled together; therefore, we held this collaborative meeting on June 29. 

#### Pre-study to clarify the reasons behind the appeal

After the analysis of the issue, the proponent hopes to install the online surveillance system. It is hoped that through the surveillance system, children can be seen at the nursery center or kindergarten. I was ill-treated. However, according to the spirit of the collaborative meeting, we will first explore the key reasons for the sponsor&#39;s proposal, and then explore whether this method can really solve the problem. After interviews and understanding, we found that the abuse problem in the nursery center or kindergarten often comes from the out-of-control nurse and the education service staff. Improving labor conditions is probably the solution to reducing child abuse. If the monitoring system goes online so that parents can watch it directly (referred to as &quot;online monitor&quot; in this meeting), parents may be too concerned about their children, so they are constantly involved in the service process of the nursery center and kindergarten, resulting in the first line. A heavier burden on personnel. If the monitor is only a video recording (called &quot;video monitor&quot; in this conference), it is not possible to install it without a dead end. 

In the area of ​​improving working conditions, the most common initiative is to reduce the teacher-student ratio. At present, the teacher-student ratio of the nursery center is 1 to 5. For kindergartens, 1 to 8 for two and a half to three years old, and 1 to 15 for children over three years old. According to the research, reducing the teacher-student ratio can greatly reduce the labor burden of the nursery staff and the education service personnel, and it is also very helpful for the education of young children. However, in terms of teachers&#39; working conditions, there are other possibilities such as raising salary and improving the relationship between teachers and teachers. The sponsors hope to install online monitors because of the poor mutual trust between parents and teachers. Therefore, how to improve mutual trust between teachers and teachers is also a problem that needs to be solved. 

To assist participants in clarifying issues, the PDIS team worked in advance with the Department of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Education to write the [Question Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_x1gw5sdlekcvtcnu1eatnjigbjs14c7zntw-ba0fnq/edit), and Send it to the participants in advance to help you understand the topic before you.

#### Considering the cost of child care and child care, the researcher has reduced the number of teachers and students more than many times without consensus 

 At the beginning of the collaboration meeting, Weifu explained that in order to reduce the teacher-student ratio, Weifu Department From October 13, 2015 to December 28, 2016, a total of 7 research conferences were held. On April 16 this year, a conference on “prospecting issues related to education and care services” was held. The case was also included in the discussion. However, there is still no way to reach a consensus on the discussion at the meeting. Wei Fu&#39;s colleagues pointed out that although reducing the care ratio can reduce the care pressure of the nurses and improve the quality of the nursery, the operating costs of the nursery center will increase, which will also be reflected in the fees, so it is difficult to form a consensus. 

Ministry of Education pointed out that the current surveillance system is not a necessary equipment for kindergartens, but public kindergartens can apply for setup with the Ministry of Education&#39;s State Education Department if they have needs; but online surveillance systems may involve issues related to human rights and privacy. . The Ministry of Education pointed out that at present, in the prevention of child abuse, the Ministry of Education has notified and managed the unsuitable personnel, and there are also penalties for improper discipline. The professional knowledge of teachers also has a way to improve, and the Ministry of Education will also actively provide a friendly working environment for the staff. 

In terms of teacher-student ratio, the Ministry of Education pointed out that the claim of the sponsors is somewhat different from the current situation. Once the teacher-student ratio is lowered, public kindergartens will reduce the amount of collections of more than 40,000 people. To maintain the current collection capacity, it is necessary to increase the number of education service personnel of more than 3,000 people. It is estimated that it will spend an additional 1.95 billion. . In the case of private kindergartens, lowering the teacher-student ratio may also increase operating costs and increase the burden on parents. The Ministry of Education said that at present, 50 kindergartens must be built in the forward-looking infrastructure, and the plan for the publicization of early childhood education should be expanded. The principle of non-profit kindergartens and public kindergartens should be promoted. The Legislative Yuan also has resolutions. After the publicization ratio reaches a certain level, based on the promotion of pre-school education service quality, it should be considered to reduce the number of classes. 

#### The first-line nursery and education service staff are under great pressure, and the parents are the biggest challenge

 During the clarification of the issue, many participants also shared their views. One teacher shared that at the teaching site, because the school is a place for group activities, the children occasionally push, fight, and noisy, but the teachers at the scene can handle it very well, but if you add an instant monitor, many times Different. She pointed out that the workload of kindergarten teachers is increasing year by year. In addition to preparation for each item, there are various administrative workloads such as updating ingredients, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and fire prevention training. She said that the biggest challenge for teachers is the parents behind them: &quot;Every parent has different requirements for children. Even the father, mother, grandfather and grandmother of the same family have different educational methods.&quot;
| The Education Industry Council pointed out that these practical aspects are the reason why the industry can&#39;t find talents, because installing monitors leads to a worse working environment, so they leave and cross other industries. The colleagues of the Chiayi Education Bureau also pointed out that the situation they encountered was often that the parents confessed to the school, the excellent teaching and maintenance service personnel left the job, and the algorithm institute also gave him innocence, and these people no longer returned to the education service industry. He also reminded that the situation of the local township is very different from that of the metropolitan area. The aunts of the locals often go to work three or four times to wait for the children to get off work. It is also difficult to find the staff of the education service in the local township: &quot;The city and the city cannot be integrated. .&quot;

#### Is the child care market mechanism? Participants have different tune

In addition to the on-site issues of the monitor, there is also a discussion on the market mechanism. Parent associations and a professor believe that the installation of monitors should return to the market mechanism. Some parents like to install. In order to meet such needs, there are naturally schools installed, and everyone should be free to choose. But another professor believes that the mechanism of early childhood education is not a market economy, nor a free economy. She pointed out that if it is the route of the market economy, what should people in low- and middle-income households generally do? She believes that the government should take the middle route. This is the question of how much the government has to enter and how much it will invest. 

 Another issue that sparked the discussion was the issue of self-editing textbooks. Private and child traders pointed out that private and young people often use workshop materials to reduce the workload of first-line teachers. But one professor believes that this is the reason for the consequences. She pointed out that the workshop set teaching materials are too far away from the children and there is no spirit of actual experience. She shared that President Tsai Ing-sung had just gone to Nanhai Kindergarten. Nanhai Kindergarten explored the playground of his own park with his children, thinking about how to improve and making a book together. &quot;We don&#39;t want to go to the past textbook-style education system,&quot; she stressed.

#### Afternoon discussion focused on improving the quality of teachers&#39; work and strengthening mutual trust between teachers and teachers

In the afternoon, the discussion focused on how to prevent child abuse, improve the quality of teachers&#39; work, and how to strengthen mutual trust between teachers and teachers. . 

The first group of discussions pointed out that the development of the floor of the teacher&#39;s salary is a feasible direction, suggesting that even the government can pay part of the teacher&#39;s salary in the future. In addition, the first-line teachers need to unite to form a trade union, so they can compete for better working conditions. However, the education staff are less labor-conscious. It is recommended that training should be included in the training of labor rights awareness; the government also needs to implement labor inspection and strengthen Irregular visits by the Education Bureau or the Social Affairs Bureau. The staff of the Education Bureau pointed out that they hope that there will be an opportunity for the auditors to wear the secret recorder, which will be more convenient and can be used as evidence for the penalty. 

In terms of the cost of the operators, the operators and the staff of the Education Bureau agree that the industry should report the financial status as much as possible, and attach the tax certificate, salary transfer documents and other certificates to the government. If the information is detailed enough, it will prove the company. The price increase should be returned to the teacher as much as possible, and the government should also approve a reasonable price increase based on the documents checked by these accountants. However, the industry believes that there are cases where the transfer documents are attached, but the review committee does not agree with the situation. The Education Bureau also believes that some operators may not be honest when they declare. 

The director pointed out that some parents are reluctant to let their children accept development assessments, causing some hidden special education students to enter the campus, causing additional burden on teachers. It may be necessary to integrate special education and general education on the premise of considering individual capitalization laws. System, or development assessment before entering the park. 

In the establishment of mutual trust, increasing the interaction between parents and the school is the most important factor. Parents can be invited to participate in the study results discussion, or the appraisal committee members can join the parent representatives, train together, and understand the good teaching site. What is the way. In the handling of disputes, on the one hand, it is necessary to establish a complaint channel for healthy third parties (for example, through the public sector). If there is a video monitor on the campus, it is necessary to establish a good method of referral, and to apply to the public sector, for example, to go to the police first. The bureau will file the case or read it through the Education Bureau or the Social Affairs Bureau.

 </figure> The second group of reports pointed out that lowering the teacher-student ratio may increase operating costs, causing parents to pay more tuition; if they are subsidized by the government budget, they may also crowd out other budgets. In strengthening parent-teacher mutual trust, parents may be given appropriate expectations for management. Officials can also encourage the media to provide positive preschool education reports to avoid negative news only; however, traditional media may lack interest in positive reporting. 

The topics discussed by the participants will be reported to the Dean at the government meeting next Monday after the PDIS team has compiled the information. The head of the relevant ministry will also get the same information. Will [Verbatem Record](https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-06-29-%e9%96%8b%e6%94%be%e6%94%bf%e5%ba %9c%e8%81%af%e7%b5%a1%e4%ba%ba%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%89%e5%8d%81%e5%85%ad%e6%ac%a1 %e5%8d%94%e4%bd%9c%e6%9c%83%e8%ad%b0)[heart map] with the issue clarified (https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9j_kz66l4a=/) Open for reference by all walks of life, but also for future reference policies can be based on reference.

#### Although the meeting is long, it can effectively clarify the issue. Participants appreciate 

The government colleagues pointed out that there are too many information on this topic, including baby care, kindergarten, public, private, non-profit, and the content of the issue. Need to digest well, the words need to be more precise, to avoid misunderstanding. One of the teachers pointed out that the issue manual clearly clarified the context, but she thought that the early childhood education scene may be less clear to everyone, so she spoke more to share the practical situation of the early childhood education scene. 

Some people believe that the differences between public and private have long been misunderstood. He pointed out that in the past few years, there have been great changes in the quality of private and child. The status of today&#39;s meeting gives everyone the opportunity to resolve many misunderstandings. He shared that many public sector meetings that had been involved before could only speak once, and there was no opportunity to refute. Today&#39;s meeting is a long time, and there are more opportunities for dialogue and clarification. Some participants also thought that some of the speeches in the middle caused a rebound, but the organizers quickly confirmed whether they felt uncomfortable. She felt that it was very good to take care of the participants&#39; feelings. She suggested that this meeting should invite more young parents to talk about the issue of children being taken care of. 

In the mind map, a professor who attended the meeting felt very much appreciated. The mind map can help you quickly clarify the context of the issue and see the relevant issues. Unlike the traditional public service system, it is often seen later. Forgot what I wrote before.&quot; He hopes that this form of meeting can be extended to more areas to help you clarify the issue.
