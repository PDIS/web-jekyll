Every summer vacation, 30 passionate young people give up their great time of fun, roll up their sleeves, and work with partners in the public sector to transform government digital services. This youth &quot;rescue&quot; government website RAY (Rescue Action by Youth) action project is about to enter its fifth edition. 

What is government digital service? Common ones include the &quot;tax declaration software&quot; used by more than five million people every year, or the &quot;eMask mask pre-purchase system&quot; that everyone used to pre-order masks last year, online household registration data, and so on. 

Have you ever found them difficult to use? &quot;If you find it difficult to use, you can also remodel it together!&quot; said a classmate who had participated in the remodeling project. Instead of being a &quot;acid man&quot; and complaining only behind the keyboard, why not contribute your enthusiasm and time, starting from the concept of &quot;user-centered&quot;, re-examine and design these online communication services that everyone has the opportunity to use . 

For example, a student in charge of the registration system of the Taipei City United Hospital, after in-depth interviews with patients seeking medical care, found that the patients often wondered which department should they be listed in? Later, the project team posted on the United Medical website. Added an interface that visualizes the human body, allowing people to first click on the uncomfortable part, and then follow the following prompts to choose the department that suits their symptoms. Use in-depth interviews to understand user needs, and modify your own ideas through contextual design tests, so that the various creative and bold ideas of participating students become feasible. 

This framework refers to the internationally accepted &quot;design thinking&quot; process, which is often used in enterprise innovation and reform. However, for many undertakers of government agencies, such a method is very strange. &quot;Many times, we plan our services in a way that &quot;the chief has the final say&quot;. Understanding user needs allows us to more effectively balance some unreasonable requests.&quot; An undertaker said. 

Through the students participating in the project interviewing the public, testing and modifying the plan, &quot;This is what we do not have the ability and time to do,&quot; a colleague from an agency also responded. This model is very helpful for him to improve the government&#39;s digital services. 

At the same time, this process also allows participating young people to learn the challenge of designing for public services: &quot;Nothing is designed to be bad, instead of blindly picking out the shortcomings of the website, you can further think about why these problems arise.&quot; A student with a design and information background said that through collaboration, he and the office clerk of the agency can understand each other&#39;s limitations and discuss possible solutions step by step in the implementation. 

Each of us is a &quot;user&quot; of government services. Now, as long as you care and have opinions, you have the opportunity to make the digital public services you come into contact with every day better, and let &quot;we&quot; become the center of service. This summer’s &quot;Government Digital Service for Young Students’ Physical Examination (RAY 5.0)&quot; project will also be launched soon. Let’s work together to upgrade government services again!
