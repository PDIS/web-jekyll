On May 25, 2018, the PDIS team held a thirty-fourth collaborative meeting at the Treasury Information Center to discuss whether legislation could prohibit companies from printing additional coupons when invoicing. 

#### Coupons cannot be recycled, and the sponsors are worried about adding garbage

Many people have experience in getting coupons after spending in the store, and even some netizens posted dozens of centimeters on the Internet. The coupons triggered a discussion among netizens. There is a Youtuber [production video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vtekdqpfxk), indicating that the current coupons cannot be recycled, and many netizens are worried that these coupons may create more garbage because they cannot be recycled. 

On February 20, 2018, Netizen Shuntsung Chang proposed on the Join platform &quot;[In the &quot;Electronic Invoice Implementation Work Points&quot; to add specifications, prohibiting it from using or optionally printing product offers](https://join .gov.tw/idea/detail/22f9d6ad-0d48-4c19-99f7-1f0f4dba8830)), I hope that I can ban or choose to print merchandise coupons in the &quot;Electronic Invoice Implementation Tips&quot; to avoid some unscrupulous The merchandise offer is printed along with the invoice, which makes the electronic invoice greatly compromised in the expected environmental protection effect. 

 At present, the government has vigorously promoted electronic unified invoices. In the process of promoting electronic invoicing, the business people&#39;s stubs have been paperless, saving half of paper. In view of the different consumer information capabilities, if no type of vehicle is used or there is a need for paperwork, the electronic invoice will be printed on paper, and the flexible electronic printing &quot;electronic invoice certificate&quot; will replace the traditional cash register unified invoice. The method of printing the period and the track number to avoid wasting paper and taking into account the convenience of both buyers and sellers. The Ministry of Finance does not regulate the use of thermal papers for electronic invoices. However, if merchants print on sensitive paper, they must comply with the specifications in Annex 2 of Point 2 of the “Electronic Invoice Implementation Operations”, and the bisphenol A content must comply with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Standards Inspection Bureau CNS15447 standard to ensure people&#39;s redemption and health rights. 

When the electronic invoice is printed, the shopping details or coupons and balance coupons will also be printed. In terms of shopping details, because most of the super-commercial consumers do not need details, the default is not to print the details. However, large supermarket operators usually set the system as a preset print order, because people generally buy more goods in the supermarket, and there is a need to count the goods. At this time, the details are indispensable. Coupons are usually accompanied by promotional activities. The balance vouchers are the balance records generated by the use of coupons issued by various industry players. These are important means for consumers to guide consumers and encourage consumers to return. 

These conference materials are written in the [Issue Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqjn76eiojo68kr7epq--0qx0vjnilxlxzjxuoh3fv0/edit) and sent to the participants before the meeting so that everyone can Read beforehand and clarify the context of relevant issues.

#### Traditional invoices require hot carbon ribbon to cause more pollution

At the beginning of the meeting, the Ministry of Finance stated that in addition to providing mobile phone barcodes as common vehicles and regulatory vehicles, the Ministry of Finance also Vehicles that actively promote credit card payment, in order to comply with the trend and trend of mobile payment, also promote the combination of mobile payment and electronic vehicles. 

Many netizens wondered why the purpose of promoting electronic invoices at the time was? According to the Ministry of Finance, electronic invoices can actually save the operating costs of physical invoices, including manpower, warehousing, shipping or shipping, etc. For consumers, because these electronic invoices contain electronic information, the government can automatically The award can save the manpower for redemption and awards, and can improve the performance. For the part of the collection authority, the manpower for sales operations and data can be saved, and the Ministry of Finance can control the invoice information to reduce the risk of fraud. 

The Ministry of Finance pointed out that the current situation of the promotion of electronic invoices from 106 years, the annual invoice volume is 6.8 billion, accounting for 70% of the unified invoice, that is to say, in the business part, at least 6.8 billion savings Sheets of paper; in the consumer segment, there were 1.08 billion invoices in the same year that were not printed, accounting for 16.42% of all invoices. 

One participant pointed out that the old-style cashier invoice will have one original and one copy, one is reserved by the store owner, and the original is taken by the consumer, so in fact, the previous year’s usage It is 9 billion sets, and the so-called &quot;9 billion sets&quot; is the invoice size of 18 billion. He said that if the paper used to convert the past 18 billion sheets of paper into paper, it would be nearly 6,000 tons. The paper used in the 7 billion electronic invoices now has a pulp consumption of only 1,500 tons. 

 This participant added that the hot paper will be hot and shiny, but in general, the paper must have a hot carbon ribbon to present the text, and how long the invoice is, how long the hot ribbon will be. These hot carbon ribbons are all plastic and have a more serious environmental pollution.

The EPA added that the current heat recovery paper recovery may be technically feasible, but it still depends on the cost considerations of the industry. If the recycling cost is too high, it may still be difficult to recycle, and the reduction at the source should be more effective. The EPA added that although everyone is not so ideal for incineration, the heat after incineration will be used for power generation, so the last way to recycle is not to recover from material, but to recycle energy. 

#### In the afternoon, I thought about the consumption surface and the environmental protection solution

 After some discussion, after lunch, the afternoon grouped into the consumer and environmental aspects to discuss. 

The first group of reports pointed out that the details should be able to try to preset not to print, print out if necessary, and reduce the printed thermal paper. In terms of coupons, the first group also suggested that consumers should be able to choose not to print out. However, you may encounter POS replacement issues, and the built-in programs need to be modified. Maybe big businesses can adopt, but small businesses may be more difficult to overcome. 

On the consumer side, the first group of recommendations should be targeted at consumers. The industry can also actively push eDM, recommend consumers to use eDM to request coupons, or use eDM to collect points, but may need to pay attention to The problem of capital law. At the same time, consumers themselves must work hard to promote each other and change consumer behavior to reduce waste. 

Environmental protection, the first group of recommendations, thermal paper can be recycled, but Taiwan does not have a complete economic scale, valuable scale, overall recycling economy. In this regard, the EPA needs to communicate with paper mills and recycling companies and provide appropriate evaluation programs.

 </figure> The second group believes that if consumers are asked to choose whether or not to print, they will still complain when they return home and will incur more costs. If you use the app as a coupon carrier, there may be a problem with the number of gaps. Some convenience stores that attend the meeting believe that although everyone wants to be paperless, many people still need paper. Sometimes, discounts are like a wide variety, and consumers are not allowed to choose which ones to print. In particular, the store staff is very busy. &quot;It is already a busy method of the Octopus Octopus.&quot; If you forget to ask, you may be sued. Convenience stores worry that if this process is added, SOPs and training will be added, which may make the consumer experience worse. 

In the printing coupon section, the second group believes that if you do not use hot paper printing coupons, the industry may use other means to print, but not environmentally friendly. The second group suggested that the EPA should clarify that there would be no toxic substances in the incineration of the heat-sensitive paper, and the content of bisphenol A is also qualified. As for the recovery of thermal paper, it is recommended that the EPA should do research to understand the status of thermal paper recycling and publish it on the Internet for public reference. At present, the implementation of electronic invoices is more environmentally friendly than the traditional invoices, and there will be no problems with hot carbon ribbons. It is necessary for the EPA, paper mills and operators to continue to clarify, so that everyone has a clearer understanding and consensus. 

These opinions will be brought to the government meeting by the political commissar Tang Feng, and will be reported to the dean and the heads of relevant ministries for reference for future policy planning; the [mental map] of the meeting (https://realtimeboard.com) /app/board/o9J_kz0WAU0=/) with [Verbatim Record](https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-05-25-%e9%96%8b%e6%94%be%e6 %94%bf%e5%ba%9c%e8%81%af%e7%b5%a1%e4%ba%ba%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%89%e5%8d%81%e5%9b %9b%e6%ac%a1%e5%8d%94%e4%bd%9c%e6%9c%83%e8%ad%b0) will also be released on the network.

#### The problem is clearly defined and there is a good solution! Collaborative meetings help clarify issues

The civil servants who assist in organizing collaborative meetings say that they have participated in collaborative meetings before they know how to do it. A live conference needs to evaluate people, equipment, technology, software, and many details to deal with. The work of handing the microphone needs to be dealt with on the spot, and the briefing time is up. It is also a problem to remind me if the camera is not blocked. 

The super-commercials who participated in the meeting believed that the discussion format of the collaborative meeting was different from that of the past public offices, and invited different people to participate. However, they also reminded that there are young people and old people in convenience stores. They need to consider the perception of different customers. More research is needed to clarify the issue of heat recovery. The sponsor suggested that if the site could not give a conclusion, it should be given a timetable for everyone to follow. 

A participant said that I didn&#39;t know what to do at first, but because the host had brought the topic to the issue of reduction and environmental protection, he could speak to answer everyone&#39;s doubts, so how can the host put it? It is important to bring the topic to the key person to have a chance to speak. He believes that the problem is clearly defined to know what to do, and tools and models such as collaborative meetings can find out the logic and clarify the problem, which is very good. However, this collaborative meeting did not invite more third-party payment vendors to attend, which may be a pity. 

The industry suggested that the government should deal with public opinion. For example, &quot;There is more people in the next door than in the past, why is it environmentally friendly?&quot; But in fact, after using the thermal paper, the total amount has decreased, but the consumption I think it is more than before because &quot;the definition of recyclability is different.&quot; 

Trying to use the issue card discussion, some people think that the card seems to be used less, he doesn&#39;t feel it; but some people think that it is good to discuss with paper, no need to think again, save to rewrite it. time. How to strengthen the discussion at the collaborative meeting site remains to be tested in the future.
