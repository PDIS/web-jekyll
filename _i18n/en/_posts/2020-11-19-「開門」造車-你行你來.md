🌏 During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Conference in mid-November, I was invited to "Open Response & Open Recovery" in the "CEO Dialogues" (CEO Dialogues). Recovery) is the topic, explaining how Taiwan can improve its economic resilience and accelerate its recovery after the epidemic. 

🔢 During the epidemic, we promoted many social innovations through public-private collaboration and open information. In addition to sharing these experiences to the world, we are also continuing to explore how to improve these practices. 

🌱 Over the years, I have met many young friends all over Taiwan. Everyone has unique observations and delicate feelings about various social issues. They also have a social mission to actively promote various changes. Starting this year, in addition to the existing mechanisms, we continued to deepen youth participation, and at the same time created brand new channels, which allowed me to see new possibilities. 

🗣️ For example, [Let's Talk](https://www.youthhub.tw), formerly a policy forum, has begun to transform into a dialogue platform between youth and government in recent years, and has become a member of the 79 countries that taiwan has joined one of the commitments of the "open government partnership alliance (ogp)". From the beginning of this year, for the first time, youth participation has been opened to the end. For example, from the beginning of the project, more than 4,000 young friends were interviewed through surveys to establish the "urban and rural education resource gap" and "reasonable working conditions and rights" as annual discussions The theme, then started, is different from the previous government-led and set-up issues, which can be called a pioneering work in government plans. 

🐱 In addition to policy discussions, the digital thinking of young friends is also the key to industrial development. Affected by the epidemic, the work and life of the world are highly dependent on the Internet, and digital transformation has become the most urgent need of many companies. In this regard, ["T Ambassador" Project](https://3t.org.tw/) recruited young friends who are interested in the four fields of smart services, digital marketing, smart manufacturing, and artificial intelligence for a half-year The implementation of the enterprise digital transformation program currently involves 26 cross-funded and foreign companies, from technology to transfer of production. In the process, apart from collaborating with professionals in various fields and discussing the direction of development, you can actually enter the company, understand existing problems, and then propose specific corporate digital transformation suggestions. 

🎓 This approach is similar to the "Young Student Medical Examination Government Website Digital Service Trainee Program" ([RAY Project](https://ray.pdis.nat.gov.tw)). RAY is a collaboration between my office and the National Development Council. During the summer vacation, 30 students with different backgrounds including service design, interface design, visual design, information engineering, etc. are invited to collaborate with government officials to improve the use of government websites. Participating agencies include Keelung City Government, the Youth Department of the Ministry of Education, and the Taiwan Employment Service of the Ministry of Labor. 

🌐 Let young friends directly take action and become a booster for the transformation of the government and enterprises-in my opinion, this is the spirit of "open the door and build a car, you do it."
