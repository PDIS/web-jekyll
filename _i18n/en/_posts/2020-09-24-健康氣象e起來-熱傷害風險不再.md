🌞 According to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of visits to the emergency department due to "heat injury" such as heatstroke and heat cramps in August this year hit a new high in the past three years, an increase of nearly 40% over the same period last year. If not handled properly, it can even lead to organ failure, with a mortality rate of over 30%. 

🌡️ In extreme climates, heat injury has become a health issue of global concern. Professor Long Shijun, who has been studying this topic for a long time, analyzed the data of the Taiwan Meteorological Bureau and the National Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2014. The journal article published in 2019 pointed out that temperature alone is not accurate. If you want to know the impact of heat damage , It is necessary to calculate the "Integrated Temperature Thermal Index (WBGT, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature)" of temperature, humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. 

📲 Earlier this year, Professor Long, together with the Bureau of Meteorology and the National Health Administration, signed up for the "President Cup Hackathon" to develop the nation’s first healthy weather warning platform-"Healthy Weather E-Up". Users only need to open "e Get up” app, you can see the personal health risks. 

👴 For example, Mr. Lin, 65, has the habit of going out for exercise every day, but he suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes, which is a high risk group for heat injury. As long as he enters his health information into "e-up", the app will push notifications on his mobile phone according to the weather of the day, reminding him to prevent heat injuries from 11 am to 2 pm, and try not to go out for exercise. 

💡 This close-to-life design is derived from the brainstorming of the team. Professor Long has never participated in a hackathon in the past. During the discussion, she found that everyone regarded themselves as "users" and actively explored the needs of potential users for innovative applications of health and weather data. This is something that rarely happened when the public sector discussed policies in the past. 

🚸 During the brainstorming process, Professor Long also shared her research on heat injury of different ethnic groups, such as laborers, farmers, and joggers. In this regard, the "e-up" team believes that only by promoting the revision of regulations from the source can the prevention and control work be deepened. 

🔊 Therefore, the team has discussed and discussed with various ministries such as the Ministry of Labor's Occupational Safety Administration, the Ministry of Internal Affairs Fire Department, the Construction Department, the Ministry of Education Sports Department, etc., and received enthusiastic responses to promote the "Occupational Safety and Health Education and Training Rules" When the laws are revised, the administrative obstacles in the past have been broken. The Council of Agriculture has taken the initiative to connect apps such as "Tianbian Good Helper" and "Agricultural E-Patch" to the "e-up" data collection, and broadcast to tens of thousands of farmers' friends in real time. 

☃ A few days ago, "Healthy Weather E-Up" was selected as one of the outstanding teams of the Presidents Cup Hackathon. After the platform is officially launched at the end of the year, it is expected to benefit at least 13 million people. The team is also discussing and including another health issue caused by extreme weather-"cold injury" as the next stage of implementation goals. 

🌏 I think that "e-up" uses the unique global health insurance database, combined with solid local meteorological research, not only actively connects the existing promotion applications of various departments, and successfully promotes regulatory amendments, but also allows us to see As the cornerstone of social innovation, academic foundation is indeed the best model of "serving the people together."
