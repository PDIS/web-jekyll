You may know that I was originally going to attend the Tokyo Olympics, but I failed to make it in order to cooperate with the Olympic Games' epidemic prevention. Fortunately, I have also met more friends who care about sports, gained a lot of sports knowledge, and can better understand the Olympic motto: "Faster, Higher, Stronger". 

In response to the recent decision of the International Olympic Games, I should now say: "Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together!" 

We can see the same development in the field of digital governance. In the past, many countries continued to pursue "faster, higher, and stronger" technology, and made every effort to build the most advanced facilities, introduce the most cutting-edge technology, and foster high-tech industrial unicorns. However, more and more countries have discovered that digital governance, like the Olympic spirit, not only needs to cultivate individual players, but also allows all people to participate. 

President Tsai proposed the "Digital Nation, Smart Island" policy program during his campaign. The Executive Yuan launched the "Digital Nation. Innovative Economic Development Program" in 2017. After the president was re-elected, he was upgraded to the "Smart Nation Program" this year, with the development vision of "Achieving an innovative, inclusive, and sustainable smart country by 2030". 

The vision of Smart Country 2030 reveals a new digital governance policy: any innovation must take diversity and tolerance as the connotation and sustainable development as the goal, which means that the government no longer formulates policies and leads from the top down The development path of industry and harmony is guided by social needs and creates an ecosystem that solves problems through "citizen partnership". 

Some people may wonder: With such a diverse society and constantly changing circumstances, how can we cater to the needs of the people without losing sight of the other? If we look back at the history of digital development, in the case of the Internet, it is not originally a single international organization that issues orders, sets standards, and builds systems for people to use. It is the people of all kinds scattered around the world who work together to build a network that connects each other. On this shared system, they invent agreements and improve problems according to their own needs, and then gradually form today's Internet. Every corner of the world, regardless of social, economic or political activities, is indispensable, and it is still vigorous and constantly innovating. 

In a diverse society, the needs of the people naturally continue to emerge. Regardless of whether the government has a corresponding strategy, there are always talented people who will use digital innovation to solve problems. Smart national digital governance policies should not lead or even prohibit these attempts, but find ways to combine the contributions of all parties and find common values. This is what I think is the first concept of digital governance: Alignment. 

For example, at the beginning of last year’s epidemic, masks were the most basic personal epidemic prevention equipment, which fell into a supply-demand imbalance for a while. The government must adopt real-name sales. Everyone wanted to know where to buy masks. Soon someone developed a map of export masks. The government did not prevent this. Instead, it used open information to immediately release the address of the pharmacy selling masks and the stock of masks in each pharmacy, and it was constantly updated. In less than a week, there were more than one hundred mask map programs developed by all walks of life, with a variety of composition, which can also be used in the communication software LINE, and voice assistance for blind people is provided. In other words, the alliance between the government and the private sector can meet the most diverse needs in the shortest time and at the least cost. 

Taiwan suffered a severe epidemic in May this year. The central command center adopted strict three-level alert, requiring that you must leave contact information when entering and exiting public places, and only when necessary, accurate epidemic investigation and contact notifications can be made. The so-called "substantial joint system." 

However, registering with pen and paper at each store may lead to long queues, which not only takes time, but also carries the risk of cluster infection. As a result, the private community began to discuss various digital solutions, and some businesses launched their own connected apps. From these discussions and private apps, the government can know what is feasible and what is not. The "1922 Short Message System" came into being in the shortest time. 

Although the government did not mandate its use, the "1922 Short Message System" soon became a part of people's lives because it combined the ingenuity of the "g0v (zero-time government)" citizen technology community: no need Install the new App, just scan the QR Code and send the text message, two actions can be completed. It is not only convenient, but also solves many worries of the public: For example, what if there is no internet? As long as you can send text messages; what if you don’t have a mobile phone? The original paper registration can still be used. 

The public are especially concerned about how to store and use the huge personal data of the "SMS" system? It is stored in the telecommunications company contracted by each person’s own number, and can only be accessed within the scope of the epidemic; users can [query access records](https://sms.1922.gov.tw/), the stored data will be deleted automatically after 28 days. all the above practices reflect the second concept of digital governance: accountability (an explanation is given). 

The key point of this concept is that digital innovation should not only save time and effort, but also make people feel at ease and not infringe on personal privacy due to digitization. In digital development, personal information protection and information security have been paid more and more attention to, and this is the reason. 

On the other hand, when new challenges occur, we must also improve in time. For example, a judge later found out that the documentary evidence contained information about the fact-linked system during the criminal investigation process and questioned its legitimacy. After discussion by all parties, the Ministry of Law also explained that the SMS system is not a private communication, and it is not within the scope of access or monitoring by the Communication Security Supervision Law; telecommunications institutions and judicial organs will also take specific measures to exclude communication monitoring from touching the SMS system. data of. 

As a strategy for national digital development, "aligning values and giving explanations" not only eliminates doubts, but also gives people peace of mind, and more actively realizes the results of citizen partnership. For example, this year’s fourth President’s Cup hackathon, regardless of the social sector, governance sector, and economic sector, can come up with innovative methods, connect data across fields, and use digital technology to solve social problems. The Presidents Cup hackathon does not provide bonuses, but for the winning teams, the president promised that the government will make every effort to promote and incorporate policy measures. More teams, with the assistance of the government, find opportunities for commercial applications. 

As a "digital political commissar", what digital means to me is to strengthen the connection between people and increase social innovation, that is, "Alignment & Accountability"-someone proposed Good ideas will be taken seriously, and partners can be found to work together to achieve them. Only in this way can a good cycle form innovative, inclusive and sustainable digital development. 

In other words, only when people across departments, fields, and fields can stand together, can digital development be "Faster, Higher, Stronger" —— Together.
