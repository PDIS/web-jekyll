An online community’s slogan: "Make reporting as easy as breathing." To help people report traffic violations more smoothly; for those who disagree, there is a fan page of "Anti-bad Reporting Devil", aiming to expose Various retaliatory and follow-up reports. The confrontation between "reporting" and "counter-reporting" citizens has become fierce on the Internet in recent years. Years ago, the news about the revision of the law that the citizens reported traffic violations became hotly debated. 
 
According to the Ministry of Communications, the public whistleblowing system implemented in 1986 can be said to give whistleblowers the most power among all countries in the world. So, what's wrong with people enthusiastically reporting and participating in public affairs? Why do I need to modify the law? 

With the popularization of smart devices, the number of excessive or targeted reports has increased. The original intention of supporting the police force with open public participation has gradually produced negative effects. For example, the prosecutor and the prosecuted party are attacking each other on the Internet, creating an atmosphere of confrontation; the police have to spend time checking the cases reported by the people, which causes crowding out of their duties; public opinion representatives have also received complaints from the people and have been improperly reported. high. 
 
 Therefore, it is necessary to improve the "quality" of public participation rather than quantity, and to use public-private cooperation more effectively to prevent major traffic violations. We therefore assisted the Ministry of Transportation in organizing a meeting, inviting "whistleblowers" and "anti-whistleblower" social platforms, the public, front-line executors, and legislators to discuss "effective" methods of whistleblowing. 

The public sector has always avoided bringing immature policies to the public for discussion, fearing being scolded and misunderstood. This time, in addition to making the draft public at the early stage, and in order to deepen the discussion, the interviews and opinions of all parties were also publicized, so that the people "come prepared." On the day of the meeting, the physical and online people were directly asked to ask questions. progress. 

In addition, the group discussion on the day specially arranged the pros and cons, people with different roles and identities together, so that everyone could hear the views or difficulties they had never thought of, and guided everyone to relax through the experienced "table leader" Chat and summarize and focus. Since the live broadcast is open to online participation, we also have dedicated people who keep a close eye on the "emotional ebb and flow" of online messages. When a netizen feels impatient because of being ignored on the spot, he must immediately respond online, and speak to netizens behind the camera as much as possible to avoid images. There is no sense of interaction when watching online videos. 
 
Some people in the meeting said that they were reported to stop at the yellow line in order to pick up children, or that all the residential areas were drawn red lines. This is a violation of the law and compelling violations; there are also police officers who said that the people are driving by themselves. Targeted reporting of disputes wastes administrative resources, and instead makes the public sector more afraid of opening up public participation. Through dialogue, everyone's experience expression can make the law more three-dimensional and closer to life. 

The Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications, Li Zhaoxian, who is in charge of this issue, is still working on the draft non-stop. After the Legislative Yuan is mentioned, there will surely be another disturbance. But his remarks after that meeting made me more convinced of the value of promoting citizen participation: "We have absorbed the greatest'compromising solution', and we are more convinced that'there is no best solution, only a better solution."
