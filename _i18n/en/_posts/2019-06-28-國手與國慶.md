üíØ Share a good news with you: "The national team of the WorldSkills Competitions (WSC) will march on this year's National Day and accept the Chinese people's applause!" Education will become the highlight of the National Day. 

 However, the original text of the above paragraph is not from me, but the Executive Yuan Youth Advisory Committee, Skills for U CEO Huang Weixiang, on June 11th in the "Technical Jobs 3.0" page post The first paragraph. 

 I believe many readers know that Taiwan has many "invisible champions" and plays an indispensable mainstay in all walks of life. Taiwan's cuisine is well-known for its popularity. In the past two years, it has become world-renowned for its Michelin competition. However, what everyone should know is that the reason why Taiwan can provide the best products and services for the world in many fields, is the soul of this group of skills trained by vocational education. 

 In fact, Taiwan‚Äôs skilled national team has already been glowing on the international stage. The International Skills Competition is a member of the 81 countries of the World Skills International (WSI). The competition is held every two years. The competition is fierce and can be said to be the Olympics in the skill world. In the 44th WSC in 2017, Taiwan won 4 gold, 1 silver, 5 bronze, 27 wins, and the winning rate was 88%. In 2015, it won 5 gold, 7 silver, 5 bronze, 19 wins, and the group ranked 3rd in the world. It is a pity that such outstanding performance has not been widely known in the past. It has not only caused the government and social resources to have an equal proportion of investment, but also led to the lack of awareness of the overall national strength of the Chinese people. Fortunately, with Wei Xiang‚Äôs proposal and the prompt dismissal of President Su Shichang at the Youth Advisory Committee, coupled with the full support of the President of the Legislative Yuan Su Jiaquan, the outstanding performance of these skilled workers will soon become part of this year‚Äôs National Day ceremony. Accept the affirmation and applause of the Chinese and foreign guests. 

 Today, there can be such a change, and the specific intention of the Executive Yuan under the planning of the former Dean of Lin Quan, the establishment of the "Year-level Youth Advisory Committee": that is, through the in-depth understanding of public policy by the Youth Advisory Committee, Active participation and suggestions can make all aspects of governance more innovative.
