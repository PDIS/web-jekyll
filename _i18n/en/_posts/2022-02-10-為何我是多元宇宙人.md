I increasingly use "Pluralist" to describe myself, and "Plurality" to describe the direction of technology that I want to see [^1]. This post is a sequel to my "Why I am not..." series [^2], trying to clarify what I mean by doing so, and the direction it might lead us. 

[^1]: Other concepts that accurately describe my ideas, but are more difficult to understand include: polycentrism and polycentric collectivism. 
[^2]: See [“Why I am not a Market Radical”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-not-a-market-radical/), [“why i am not a statist”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-01-28-5ixa34/), [“why i am not a capitalist”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-01-28-5ixa34/ www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-01-14-j73qnz/), [“why i am not a nationalist”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-02-18 -9qwoyc/), [“why i am not a technocrat”](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/2019-08-19-bv61r6/). 

This article, partly through my academic-technological lens, filters a lot of what I've learned since Eric Posner and I published Radical Markets, but more from my RadicalxChange board members Danielle Allen, Audrey Tang (Tang Feng) and Christopher Kulendran Thomas have learned something [^3]. While this article raises many questions, it is my hope that these questions will be precise enough and asked in an unprecedented way to help spark a cohesive and diverse agenda related to technology.

B. du Bois, Liam Kofi Bright, Edmund Burke, John Dewey, James Allen Evans, Henry Farrell, Marion Fourcade, Pope Francis, Corrado Gini, Jaron Lanier, Pope Leo XIII, J. C. R. Licklider, Georg Simmel, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Alexis De Toqueville, Annibal Quijano, Deva Woodly. 

For these reasons, I think some of the things mentioned in the article, for non-technical It may feel a bit verbose for an expert. To those who are not concerned with the development of formal institutions and protocols, some principles of pluralism seem logical and do not require so much elaboration, analysis, or study. 

 But I must remind that the current mainstream direction of information technology development (AI on the one hand, and research around Web3 and the metaverse on the other) is usually conceived to represent totalism and atomism. ), thereby developing the prospect of serious conflict with pluralism. 

 Although many arguments are obvious to those who understand pluralism and have been soaked in their thinking patterns. Then, if pluralism is to survive the technological change of our time, there is now an urgent need for someone to develop a coherent technological agenda for it (what I will call multiverse "Plurality") to counteract these opposing trend. 

 I will start by clarifying definitions and logical comparisons, emphasizing the institutional design and thought patterns of pluralism, and then using various concrete examples to illustrate the contours of these two aspects, from which I will summarize a series of quasi-universal concepts about the multiverse. quasi-formal principles. 

 Next, while one might be concerned that multiple thinking might be too vague to yield concrete insights into institutional design, I will argue that it in fact provides at least one core element of the multiverse The ideal basis: "the principle of cooperation across diversity" (the principle of cooperation across diversity). 

 I will present what are the practical challenges to making pluralistic institutions work, and why I feel they can be overcome. Finally, I'll share what I understand to be important areas of research that could be shaped into a multi-technology agenda that's more ambitious and transformative than AI or Web3—and more fascinating. Finally, I offer my blessings for this. 

## Clarifying Definitions

 Pluralism, as I understand it, is a social philosophy that recognizes and promotes prosperity and cooperation among diverse sociocultural groups and systems. 

In the following, I will illustrate the pluralism I know from two aspects: institutional theory and epistemology. 

 Institutional pluralism contrasts with a range of social philosophies that might be described as "monists" (which I jokingly call these in a related article [ALONE: Atomic Liberalism and Objectivity] The Naive Epistemology of Radicalism](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/why-i-am-not-a-market-radical/)). Monistic philosophies tend to focus on isolated individuals and/or the unified/universal structures in which these individuals are located. 

 The atomistic ideology premised on the isolated individual is often used to justify capitalism because it emphasizes both the group and the individual. However, for institutional pluralism, the group is not just the carrier of individual interests, but the fundamental value with the basic meaning of its existence. At the same time, centralistic ideologies premised on single or universal structures are often used to justify populist statism and nationalism. 

 On the contrary, institutional pluralism denies the centrality of any one group/collective (eg nation-state, universal human rights, etc.). 

 Epistemological pluralism contrasts sharply with those cognitive traditions (most notably technocracy, or technocracy) that seek consistency and commonality. It does this by denying that any single rational logic or meritocratic solution can be the optimal solution to the social order. 

 Epistemological pluralism values diversity, emphasizing the importance of these incompatible collective entities and intellectual cultures co-connected—interwoven and collaborative, with differences and coexistence. 

 Here, I think it is necessary to give some examples (see "Multiple Institutions" and "Multiple Thinking"), which naturally come from my earlier published comparisons. But before presenting, I outline some additional qualifications below. 

## Qualifications

 Pluralism is an element that emerges in a variety of philosophies and plays a role in some important ideas, which I do not accept myself, but have learned a lot from. It plays an important role in some conservative, religious and reactionary thought. It is also relatively important in postmodern, cultural relativism and nihilistic thought. In order to clearly separate my thinking from these schools, which I have mostly rejected, three other elements of my thinking must be emphasized here, which I have not added to the above pluralism for the sake of brevity. 

 1. The first is what could be called "dynamism" or "liberalism", i.e. I think the evolution of social groups is crucial to the success of pluralism. This is in stark contrast to conservative, many religious and consociational ideas, in which the pluralism that constitutes a social group is often seen as static. 

 2. The second is "self-government" or "democracy", i.e. I believe that diverse groups need to be accountable to the individuals who make them up, but cannot place these individuals above the basic meaning of the group , which is very important; this is in contrast to reactionary ideas such as fascism and corporatism, which refer to groups often with authoritarian, individualistic, and hierarchical structures. 

3. The last element is called "cooperation", that is, we should aim at cooperation and reach a general agreement/consensus for a common goal in a social group, which Also contrasted with much postmodernism, relativism and nihilism. 

 Therefore, it can be said that I am a "Cooperative Liberal Democracy Multiverse Man", but the two nouns in the middle have quite a lot of meanings, so I use the more concise nouns to express, I hope this supplement is enough. [^4]

 Equally important to stress is that pluralism is more inclusive and defined than most monistic positions such as "majority rule" and "capitalism". Related to its idiosyncrasies, it does not offer complete institutionalization and design, but it conveys more clearly what it seeks. 

 Admittedly, this may obscure the position I am claiming, or confuse it with what I do not want to defend, so I hope that the rest of this post will be more clearly communicated, pointed in the direction of my the meaning of. 

[^4]: In many ways, my thinking comes closest to a metamorphosis from the ideas of progressive pragmatists (eg Georg Simmel, John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois, Iris Marion Young, Deva Woodly). Even so, however, the specific disagreements these thinkers are concerned with, and the pluralism in relation to historical injustice that the American left is concerned with, do not get me too much attention; I look more at finding the formal rules of consensus to find those Which differences are most worthy of highlighting between historically marginalized groups and historically favored groups. 

## Pluralistic systems

As mentioned above, the vague "cooperative liberal democratic pluralism" sounds like a refrain at first. Don't everyone like these? 

Therefore, I would like to point out some stark contrasts that I hope will illustrate - according to the above definitions and conditions - pluralistic institutions, and many institutions that are used in reality, and that are advocated by most reformers in the current political environment How is the system different. To make the question more concrete, let me illustrate with some existing systems that have clear characteristics of pluralism. 

1. The U.S. Constitution is a well-known federalist (Federalist), in the division of power between the states and the national government and the system of representation across the country, the Senate and the Electoral College are given according to the number and population of each state. Weights. 

2. A "Consociational" regime that clearly represents its balance of power along the divisions (whether political, racial or linguistic) that have formed throughout history, eg: Belgium and Switzerland (linguistic divisions), Abbey (Abiy) Ethiopia (racial divide), South Africa (ethnic divide) and Colombia and the Netherlands (political divide) before they came to power. Perhaps the most widely known: "confessional" coalition regimes, where all positions of power are constitutionally provided, based on sectarian groups, and checks and balances encourage inter-sectarian cooperation to achieve political ends. Lebanon, Iraq and Northern Ireland are prime examples. 

3. Corporatist political theory also emphasizes "plurality", which means a pluralistic system that is born with different material/industrial categories/occupational experience/professional knowledge/interests. This idea is deeply rooted in classical (such as Plato) and religious (such as Catholic social thought) political theory, and has influenced political institutions ranging from German corporate co-decision programs to the Irish Senate, for example. In the first half of the twentieth century, however, they were perhaps the most ambitious attempts, and were also closely associated with fascism and fascist-inspired governments. Social scientist Corrado Gini, famous for his research on the Gini coefficient, led the design of a system of functional representation that divided power primarily by industry and factors of production, replacing national parliaments under Mussolini . 

4. Most of the existing international organizations and alliances (such as the United Nations and the European Union) combine the representation of constituent countries according to different principles, these principles include: basic population representation, representation of constituent countries, Civil society representation, etc. The European Union, for example, has a parliament roughly based on proportional representation of the population, a council largely based on national representation, and a range of formal representation bodies for society, citizens and interest groups. These forces coexist in a rich set of checks and balances. 

 In the broad liberal (in a general philosophical sense), old left philosophical and political circles I frequent, such pluralism is often dismissed. There is little respect for the Senate or the Electoral College system, almost tacitly, that direct proportional, one-person-one-vote direct elections are the best way to replace them, coalition regimes are also seen as repressive relics of history, and corporatism is often seen as abusive , only half a step away from fascism itself. 

 Many people hoped in their hearts that the federal and confederate structures could be replaced by some kind of direct international democracy. And among those drawn to systems thinking, there is widespread disappointment and shame that multiple factors (such as interest group politics and even political parties) have crept into "clean" democracies. 

 Of course, there are some key issues that drive these skepticism. In an era of heightened sociopolitical rifts that spread along religious, racial, and state (rural versus urban) geographic lines, whether minority interests protected by the American system (mainly the Electoral College that protects small states) are of paramount concern interests, this is not clear. 

 However, if you dig a little deeper, it soon becomes apparent that almost all of these advocates of monism lack deep conviction in the ideas they support: most will admit that without a range of measures to protect the minority, One person, one vote often leads to disastrous results. 

Even the European parliamentary democracy, which is most admired by such advocates, contains a large number of elements of pluralism, such as: federalism within each member state (such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain), political parties From proportional representation and forming alliances to the informal Polder system in the Netherlands. Most also empathize with at least some form of principles of subsidiarity, explicit impersonal protection of the rights of certain groups, etc. 

 Following this line of thought, the next question to ask is: Why should these problems be solved by eliminating pluralism and restoring monism? Why not solve this problem by leaning more towards pluralism and forming more cognition? While this makes the problem seem more complicated, modern social network theory and the resulting algorithms are designed to deal with this complexity. 

## Pluralism

 However, before showing how this works, it is necessary to turn to the other side of pluralism, epistemology. As mentioned above, when I stress the universal applicability of pluralism in practice, I also refer to the "resistance" against it. I think these resistances can and should be resolved naturally through the thinking and cognition driven by the development of pluralism. 

 The reality of pluralism, perhaps more so than the reality of plural institutions, consider some of the following examples: 

### 1. Religion 

Most religions, at least in their pure form , both claim to be exclusive expositions of basic metaphysics. However, given the diversity of devout religious beliefs in rational civilizations, most successful religions have reached pluralistic understandings with other faith groups, respecting each other's beliefs, seeking cooperation and learning - especially in the ethical and political realms - At the same time, each maintains its commitment to its religious community. 

 Although in the history of religion there have been countless "syncretic" beliefs that have attempted to unify and eliminate this diversity from happening (e.g. Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Universalism (UUU ), Bahá'ís), but the most successful of these has been in increasing the diversity of beliefs; there does not appear to be any steady peaceful flow of existing beliefs into a universal attractor. On the other hand, political ideology and ethics that seek to justify themselves in the native terms of various beliefs are crucial to the development of contemporary national and international law. 

### 2. Languages

 is divided into 91 languages in more than a dozen language families, spoken by more than 10 million people, and a larger number of languages spoken by fewer people. Whether one agrees with the various versions of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, according to which certain ideas are inconceivable in certain languages, or, to put it more euphemistically, it is clear that certain languages are more Language is better for expressing certain ideas. Thus, these linguistic differences are important in some directions, reflecting the social conditions that host them. 

 Attempts to unify languages, to a large extent, can be said to have been carried out under colonial or other forms of coercion, rather than through the pursuit of rational transcendence; There is almost no argument to support what kind of "rationality". At the same time, translation (often with the help of automation) is becoming more accessible every day, and the ability of texts to resonate across languages through good translation is both an important milestone and a significant key to its success. 

 Moreover, even in the unification process of some languages, their dominant languages continue to evolve and sub-culturally split (eg Standard White English vs Standard Black English). Even in some emerging, nerdy fields, such as programming languages, competing architectures are proliferating and have trade-offs. 

### 3. Academic field

Academic field - At least in the broad scientific field, people generally try to use some kind of general "scientific method" to pursue a certain concept of absolute truth. In practice, however, domains and subdomains (and subdomains!) are often built on mutually inconsistent premises. 

 Let me highlight some of my work in academia that are closely related to these cases. Economics is based on the scarcity, rationality and methodological/institutional individualism of private goods; sociology is based on collective goods, semiotics and methodological/institutional collectivism. In economics, the field of public finance essentially rules out the existence of market forces, while the field of industrial organization rules out inequality and general equilibrium. 

While this may indeed be an attempt to bridge areas and sub-areas, they are at any one time only a small fraction of overall activity and are underfunded; most importantly, the result is usually not to displace related areas, but to Is the birth of a new field or subfield (eg, data science from statistics and computer science, behavioral economics from economics and psychology). At the same time, most significant influences of academia on practice (or at least those that have been generously accepted by history) require collaboration and agreement across domains (e.g., the birth of the Internet and the personal computer, the most valid correspondence, etc.). 

While such diversity is a core and enduring feature of these and many others (e.g. sports, technology, industry), dissatisfaction with this heterogeneity is persistent and attempts to overcome it are more common of. With regard to religion, any atheist sees (ostensibly "inconsistent") religious diversity as proof of their belief in the ability of a single "reason" (which, as mentioned above, itself to be very elusive) to explain everything. 

 And about the multiverse of languages, many look back at the story of the Tower of Babel with sadness, imagining that one day all people will speak a common, universal and "rational" language. With regard to academic diversity, interdisciplinary agendas often turn to aspirations for a "theory of everything," for example, reducing economics to psychology, or replacing special relativity and quantum mechanics with broader string theory. 

 However, as with the desire for methodological monism, attempts at grand unification have historically been more than failures: it is hard to imagine what a coherent successful attempt would look like. What does it really mean to have a religion that embraces all past religions, not their replacements, unless, like (especially new, neo-) atheists, simply wish to throw away all metaphysical aspects that reject religion? 

 Attempting to formulate the language problem rationally as an optimization problem (such as the commonly discussed information-theoretical analysis of the lexical parsimonious distribution of concepts) can yield some interesting observations; It may be naive to think of as a potential basis for designing an actual language, at least for the foreseeable future. 

 First of all, when we look back on the long history of human beings, these attempts are obviously overly absurd simplifications of this basic problem, which involves at least from contextual narration, cohesion, memory to adapting to a huge environment Diversity and dozens of related factors. 

 Second, even if the problem could be formally defined, finding a near-optimal solution over all possible sets of languages would almost certainly be computationally difficult in any possible time period; and almost certainly Certainly this involves a range of non-convexities and flat regions, which means that its output is itself as a multilingual hybrid. 

 Thirdly, and most fundamentally, there is almost certainly no context-independent optimal solution, so any even approximate optimal solution would involve at least some degree of linguistic diversity, although it It may not be as incomprehensible as the current languages. 

 Looking at the above, a "rational" or near-optimal language is almost unimaginable, and the few attempts to achieve this goal (eg Esperanto, Esperanto, which I have spoken and been quite passionate about) here), and have had only limited success, either in terms of actual adoption, or in achieving anything akin to proving optimal or just better than existing languages to be widely accepted. 

 Looking back at the scientific tradition of rationalism, it makes the unity of scientific knowledge seem less out of tune than the first two examples, but I believe to a large extent this is just an illusion, all preventing language or religion The unifying factor is stronger in the field of academic research. 

Imagine a coherent field of analysis in which one can receive meaningful training that brings together computer science, economics, sociology, anthropology, analytic philosophy, and continental philosophy into a single set of standards and points , at least on the surface, as absurd as it is with language. Taking seriously the value contained in these areas without obliterating commitment to other areas involves many challenges in unifying religions. 

 Thus, an epistemology emerges naturally again, parallel to institutional pluralism. Rather than aspire to amalgamation of all fields into a single theory, or progress toward some universal truth, why not pursue the growing concretization and differentiation of knowledge, actively investing in the communication of these disparate fields of expertise to develop specific applications and techniques? 

 That is, why not imagine knowledge as a quest for a "non" single, ultimate and universal truth, in the spirit of ecology, as a gradual evolution, stable coexistence, with development Reified, complex variety? 

## Principles of the Multiverse

 So far, the similarities between multiple systems and multiple epistemologies, I hope you have come to the fore. To highlight their similarities, I'll propose a set of principles that apply to both. 

1. Recognition: Recognition (formally or intellectually) of social groups/schools of thought and giving them an epistemological or institutional position that transcends the sum of their members/individual thoughts. 

 2. Subsidiarity: The ideological activities and issues that mainly involve a certain social group, or its members, or its concerns, should be entrusted to the collective leading group or intellectual authority of the group, rather than by a more Large, or high-level organizational control or analysis to make rules. At the same time, the broader organization/analysis is largely concerned with the interactions between the narrowly defined organization/analysis rather than its behavior/specific analysis directly. 

3. Neutrality: A set of formalisms and analytical practices acceptable to broad ethnic groups that should govern interactions between social groups/areas of analysis (including individuals) because, So people will have a rough consensus. That is to say, the rules of the game they operate are not actually biased towards a certain group/field. 

4. CAD principle (Cooperation across diversity): Actions and opinions that are widely recognized (at multiple levels) across a range of social groups should receive more trust, even if its average individual The level of recognition is not high. 

 5. Adaptation: Which groups and fields are recognized and should adapt to the natural changes of the group. As an important factor for the exchange of society and knowledge, encouraging social affinity and the opening of new models of intelligence, the dynamic formation of new groups and new fields, should be the goals of the social system. 

 Most of the principles are self-explanatory and have appeared in many pluralist discourses. Regardless of their differences, the more controversial points are probably 3 and 5. Neutrality is not a criterion in some pluralist ideas/applications, which are tolerant rather than egalitarian attitudes towards certain social groups. 

 I don't particularly focus on this idea, because once there are formal rules of neutrality, it is predictable which parts are to be excluded from the concept of pluralism. So, from my point of view, the core task would be: to establish neutral formal rules of pluralism, and it is up to those who apply it to decide which forms of difference are appropriate. 

Perhaps most pluralist philosophies/institutions (especially those with conservative tendencies) tend to refuse to adapt and continue to focus only on certain fixed social groups. While this may seem to me at odds with most pluralists, it seems to me that if pluralism is to be able to respond to the critics discussed above and survive in the face of other, more dynamic social philosophies, This is not so much a design consideration as it is a necessity. 

 Therefore, these criteria, although different from other philosophies of pluralism, are necessary to answer the above-mentioned existential questions about pluralism. 

## Pluralistic Examples of Pluralistic Institutions

 So the question arises, can pluralistic thinking support pluralistic institutions? Is multiple thinking too broad and inconsistent to support multiple institutional designs? I'll try to illustrate why this works, and show a range of convergences in perspectives on multiple institutional design as an illustration. I would like to single out one of the above principles, CAD (Collaboration Across Diversity), and illustrate how diverse thinking supports it. 

 Since this article is primarily intended to inspire and convince formal technologists, I will focus more on formal models as a rationale/derivative way of structuring institutions, rather than a comprehensive Formal analysis. 

 I will show that highly simplistic and implausible assumptions about social structure (which even the strongest advocates of typical monistic models and conclusions would agree are mere simplifications), once extended, tend to Forms of reasonable assimilation support the pluralistic institutions discussed above. To this end, I will focus on seven cases that are not exhaustive, but hopefully representative. 

### 1. Statistical Epistemology 

 The "wisdom of crowds" argument is often used to justify market systems (such as prediction markets) and democratic systems. 

 This goes back at least to Marquis de Condorcet's famous "Jury Theorem" (1785): the view that if many people have independent and equally distributed signals about truth (independent and identical distribution, iid), then an equal vote of all is more likely to obtain the truth than a vote of a subset. 

 The strength of this result as a pro-democracy case has been exaggerated, and the same logic implies that those with more precise signals should be given greater weight, unlike the standard one-person-one-vote rule. 

 However, a richer and more general variant, one that does not require any inequitable assumption, that the signals are generally not independently distributed. One of the things that almost everyone accepts in contemporary politics is that there are different "tribes" (Tribes) whose prejudices are tied to their views (and possible errors). 

 While the exact best estimator depends on the exact structure of the statistical dependencies, there is a strong and straightforward statistical intuition that should give a greater accumulation of relatively independent signals than those with correlated errors Weights. 

 This principle is often called "consilience" in philosophy of science. It suggests that courses of action that are supported by different groups in society and therefore less likely to collude should receive greater relative credibility than any symmetric/exchange function of individual credibility. This tends to support the principle of cooperation across differences. 

 It is also broadly consistent with neutrality in that there seems to be a reasonable, broad social consensus on the structure of associations even without a particular view of precision. Finally, it appears to be quite adaptable, precisely because it is based on the statistical nature of the general norm, rather than on specific historical circumstances that are seen as immutable. 

### 2. Statistical Powers 

 Penrose (1946) analyzed the voting power of an entity with many votes relative to an entity with a single vote. 

 With individual preferences independent and identically distributed (iid), a person with M votes has the same chance as M² people with one vote each to change the outcome, because on average, voters with iid tend to offset each other's preferences. 

 Therefore, Penrose believes that delegations should have voting rights equal to the square root of the population they represent, a rule that is roughly enforced in the Treaty of Nice that forms the basis of EU voting. 

 As in the previous example, for every ticket to be iid-compliant, or part of an invulnerable coalition, the assumption is rarely true. Conversely, political science tells us that various social membership relationships are often correlated with voting preferences, but rarely fully correlated. 

 In this case, balancing the effective voting power of parties and groups would be more complicated than a simple square root rule would suggest, but would likely follow a similar pattern of nature. Therefore, the votes of closely related groups should be downweighted relative to population size compared to the votes of very unrelated groups in society, which makes the power of choices with broad social support less than the population size of supporters relatively enlarged. 

### 3. Game and Incentive Theory

My academic background is mainly based on mechanism design based on game theory. Most mechanism designs are premised on individual self-interest, in terms of monetary equivalents. Quadratic Voting (QV) is a near-optimal collective decision-making procedure among large groups based on this discourse. 

 In this procedure, individuals use some currency (usually evenly distributed voice credits) to express their approval or disapproval of various proposals or candidates. However, the total support received is not a linear sum of individual contributions, but also adds an "interaction" component, so the limited contribution of many people is more powerful than the huge contribution of a single person. 

 This effect is quite significant: 1 token per 1000 people is equal to 1 million tokens per person. This solves the "free rider" problem, where individuals contribute less to large projects. 

 However, the atomized assumption of personal self-interest is generally understood to be "narrow". Socially close individuals tend to have an altruistic focus on each other's interests that can directly address the free-rider problem. Failure to take this into account can lead to a situation where the QV "oversolves" and skews the results too much toward the associated group. 

Buterin (2019) showed that this problem can be overcome if the squared term related to interactions between groups with altruism (as revealed by their actions in the mechanism) is reduced. It also illustrates that an approximately optimal voting mechanism is possible by combining linear and squared terms according to the social closeness of the relevant individuals. 

 This tends to support diversity, as interaction terms between socially distant individuals will be preserved while those between socially closer individuals are offset, allowing for social diversity support projects with more homogeneous support. 

### 4. General Equilibrium Economics

 The typical framework for understanding the economy as a whole is “Comprehensive Equilibrium”. General equilibrium theory suggests that, under certain conditions, a capitalist economy with appropriate endowment effects produces all desirable outcomes. 

 However, there are two key conditions: all goods are private (consumed by one person); the production of these goods exhibits "diminishing returns" (the quantity produced jointly by a set of resources is at best acted upon by each person alone) the sum that can be produced). 

 These conditions exclude most phenomena related to modern society, such as technological innovation, network effects, infrastructure, cities, etc. Groves and Ledyard (1977) showed that a simple, global public good could be added to this setting and use a quadratic mechanism like QV to preserve optimality. 

 More generally, the cost of infrastructure and public goods that cannot be covered by marginal cost pricing and voluntary contributions must be financed through individual participation. Since support for these shared goods will benefit all those who share their value, and many people have contributed to supporting these goods, even selfish individuals often care about shared consumption networks in shared goods, The material status of those closely associated with them. 

 This produces effective altruistic concerns as part of "enlightened self-interest". This in turn should, like (3) above, require a hybrid mechanism of quadratic and linear (or quadratic in some rotated space) necessary to achieve efficiency, as in Immorlica et al. (2019) explored the effect. For similar reasons, these mechanisms should effectively subsidize cooperation across "social" (joint participation in shared goods) distances. 

### 5. Security and trust

In a typical model of network security, each link in the graph has a weight, which represents the link that can be passed without causing failure Relationships (the value of trust). Relationships can pass through nodes that are not directly connected through a "friend of friends" relationship. The weakest link on the path determines the maximum trust that this connection can promote. The total strength of the relationship can be calculated by the "maximum traffic" of the network. 

 If we consider the value that cooperation across more than two individuals can bring, then the need for maximum flow must be met simultaneously. If the trust paths of the alliance members to the collaborators are independent, the total trust that the alliance can achieve will be closest to the sum of the trusts among the members. 

 However, if these paths intersect, then the total trust will be sub-additive, because trust in one member congested the trust path in another member. 

 For example, if all consortium members are ultimately connected by only a single link, then no more trust will lead to any federation than that link can import. Therefore, the degree of social diversity of subsidizing partner paths determines the degree of trust an alliance can have. 

### 6. Security against Attacks

Another security model, closely related to the model used for research/proof blockchain, considers the situation that validator nodes may be compromised/attacked, and The system is classified according to the proportion of nodes required for an attack to succeed. 

 These statistics, which implicitly assume that the probability of a validator being destroyed, is independent of validators; such an assumption seems to be very rare given how viruses and other attack vectors work. 

In reverse thinking, if there is a model in which there is a network between validators, each weighted edge represents the probability that an attack that infects a node propagates to adjacent nodes along the edge. In this case, the possibility of destruction of connected nodes may be unavoidable, but simultaneous destruction of distant nodes is very difficult. 

 Therefore, a resilient system is much less likely to fail than those guarantees based purely on the number of nodes (or computing power) destroyed, unless many independent clusters are destroyed. In other words, this guarantee will make attackers need more independent attack points. 

 This also shows that if the network structure of a system is visible, but it cannot see which nodes are attacked, then the consensus that requires diversity will be more important than the threshold of computing resources or nodes in preventing attacks. efficient. Similar analysis applies to some supply chain planning that spreads across social networks, and to predictions of war or disease. 

7. Decentralization, checks and balances, and cancer: One of the most common problems in the design/analysis of complex systems is stability/robustness. 

 Biological systems that fail to clear cancer die, and as Madison writes in The Federalist Papers No. 10, a similar argument applies to avoiding the dictatorship of political factions. 

 Biological, political, or other institutional checks and balances are often designed to avoid this outcome. For example, Madison argued that the various agencies of the U.S. Constitution have different electoral principles, making it impossible for all agencies to be captured at the same time. 

 Let's formalize this logical thinking: Consider a network that represents the probability or strength of political coordination (or cancer spread) between two actors (or physical locations). Avoiding factional (or cancer) domination will require checks and balances, and this is linked to cyber distance. Therefore, clusters that are close together on the network cannot capture multiple institutions at the same time. In such system design, major changes require collaboration across diversity. 

 While my main focus is on the theoretical frameworks that can be used to derive institutional design, several more fragmented but related empirical frameworks from different fields tend to point in the same general direction. They include: 

1. Much of the work in scientific and technological research, including quantitative analysis by James Evans and many of his collaborators, shows that scientific innovation often arises from communication in areas of science that were not previously communicated. An excellent review of this work was recently published in the journal Science. 

2. In recent years, there has been an explosion of literature in organizational and business research showing the benefits of diverse development of teams/organizations in various dimensions, from cultural to cognitive. Some excellent recent reviews have been written by Scott Page and McKinsey. 

3. The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow emphasizes the extreme importance of human cultural, organizational and political diversity in the production of modernity and progress throughout human history, revealing These multiplicities are themselves notions of existential meaning. 

## Challenges to the Pluralistic System

 The above simple description proves the self-consistency of pluralism, but it is only the first step. A monist may make many natural criticisms of pluralism. As mentioned above, I can only respond "briefly and to the point"; a complete, persuasive response would not only require too much space, but more importantly, it would require more research, space development, and support than it does today. 

 Nevertheless, I still think that there are enough reasons to believe that these problems will be overcome. I take these criticisms very seriously, because they are my own criticisms of other social philosophies. Listed as follows: 

 1. Is the multiverse not clear enough? 

 While many of the ideas seem to support some form of pluralism, they are far from converging on some single optimal schema agreement, and indeed the whole argument gives reason to be concerned about the situation Appeared to be pessimistic. This raises some fundamental questions about pluralism. 

 First of all, what are pluralists really supporting? Do they have enough consensus and hope to defend together? 

Secondly, does this flexibility give technically savvy elites a lot of room to design ostensibly neutral pluralist pacts, but in fact privilege their narrow perspectives and/or interests? ? (This issue has been particularly prominent in my past work.) 

 I am cautiously optimistic that many of the (provable) optimal or near-optimal agreements that address one particular model above, in several remaining models is also robust, near-optimal, or at least far superior to monistic alternatives. 

 If this belief is validated, it should be possible to maintain epistemological pluralism without compromising its success. If pluralists can agree that there is at least some kind of pluralism that they all like and accept, and that it is not an alternative to monism, then the existing reasonable diversity can be combined with the support (and epistemological pluralism) of pluralism. The widely developed movement coexists. 

 And if such agreements consist of a relatively small number of reasonable and robust agreements, the space for parameter manipulation by narrow interests can be curbed. 

2. Is the multiverse too risky? 

 How to identify whether this is actually useful, not just a theoretically feasible system, needs to be carried out through a large number of social experiments. Many of these systems are new and unheard of, and require a lot of social digestion to reach their potential. 

 On the societal level that I use to advance the problem, it seems unimaginably risky to conduct such experiments, especially at a time when all kinds of technologically mediated social experiments are already wreaking havoc. Is there a reasonably safe way to run a pluralistic system? 

 Fortunately, the past decade has seen the emergence of a rich and growing space for new socio-technical experiments. Two prime examples are the "Web3" community and the emerging cluster of "digital democracies" led by Taiwan, but also a significant part of the expanded Baltic states, East Asia and Australasia. 

In these places, people are exploring various new social organization models, and have achieved great success, Taiwan's situation and an important part of the Web3 community, both contain diverse value orientations. This suggests a range of natural laboratories for experimenting with these new social technologies in relative safety—but with real social engagement and stakes. 

In addition, the multi-level concept of diverse social organizations naturally opens up space for experimentation. The block-like area of a series of organizations (churches, companies, government organizations, trade unions, etc.) the natural habitat of ideology. 

Cities are politically paragons of organizational size and seem to be the most appropriate places for such experiments, since the number of cities in the world is about the same as the population of a typical city, and almost every important organization has some similar Hierarchy, where experimentation flows naturally, and pluralism can self-generate and rationally follow patterns to solve problems. 

Consider business, which generally sees sectoral differentiation as a necessity, but which is also the root cause of some of their toughest problems; perhaps pluralism is a natural solution. 

3. Will the multiverse be too centralized? 

 Another concern is that the algorithm described above appears to rely on a panoptical perspective of social relations, performing complex computations on the entire social network. Such a panoramic view is unrealistic, and even if achievable, would be undesirable for any entity due to its intrusive nature. 

 While I strongly agree with the motivation behind this concern, I doubt it necessarily applies to the situation we are discussing. Of course, the implementation of some of the above protocols will depend on the panoramic view, but various protocols in the network can operate in a highly decentralized (or at least polycentric) and near-zero-knowledge way, which has an impact on performance will be limited. 

 Concerns about centralization can and should be a (soft and flexible) constraint, but not a We should be limited to finding the most attractive solutions. 

4. Is the multiverse manipulable? 

 A closely related concern is that the above-mentioned pluralist mechanisms try to find bridges through methods such as "subsidies" and build rare consensuses with social groups that have never cooperated. Such a development appears to be a "tax" on strong ties, and may therefore encourage people to suppress and hide these social ties. [^5]

[^5]: This concern is closely related to the degree of centralization of the system. The tendency to centralize and hide information is exactly what economists often worry about as the problem of incentive misalignments. 

 Meanwhile, the Multiverse embraces and extends important incentive design principles. The first principle, commonly referred to in economists as "Monotonicity", states that when the goals of the system are aligned with those of the actors, the system should obey the preferences of those actors. The principle of subsidiarity can be seen as an extension of this principle in groups, and pluralism recognizes the recognition of actors by standard economic theory. 

 The second principle is that “countervailing incentives” means that if the system creates incentives for actors to exaggerate some variable, then there should be a countervailing incentive to reduce this variable. 

 A classic example is the Harberger Tax, in which the owner of a property often has an incentive to inflate the price of the property being sold, and this incentive can be achieved by taxing the sale price they promised to offset. While the details may vary by specific algorithm, it is reasonable to focus on its value as a principle to constrain institutional design. It just so happens that a naturally and well-functioning multiverse also tends to involve precisely these counteracting incentives. 

 In ambitious multiverse applications, the "money" we expect individuals to have (a single variable representing universal social value/respect) is replaced by higher dimensional social currency that acts as a reflection of the individual Respect held within a particular social group or relationship. 

 Actors will be motivated to exaggerate their ties and respect within their group, just as they would like to have more wealth in a standard capitalist economy. But this motive would counteract the "subsidy" incentives in the "multiverse" to underreport social relationships in order to shape them. 

 Similar logic applies to community incentives, that is, the community will exaggerate certain motives such as specific issues, the degree of internal solidarity, and the strength of internal institutions, etc., in order to maximize the representation of the community on the issue. Sex and power; this incentive to maximize representation counteracts the subsidy incentive to maximize cooperation across differences. 

Although all this may be somewhat abstract and beautiful, it gives me real hope in the reference to everyday things that it can play a role in a formal system. 

For example, we rarely see white men choosing to try to impersonate black women, even though “affirmative action” would allegedly motivate this practice. The reason is simple, the identity of white men is the source of their social power, and few people are willing to give up their social power for the limited benefits provided by "affirmative action". 

 In reality, we will see some "cross-identity" constraints from different angles, because this may destroy the established social bonds, even for some very marginalized communities these are social cost. Not that there are no social groups trying to hide their ideals, especially when they are severely persecuted, but in a world where social capital is king (obviously our world, and even more so in a world governed by pluralism) So) people trying to destroy the social capital they have, seems unlikely to be a major problem. 

5. Is the multiverse legitimate? 

 Perhaps the most immediate challenge to the multiverse is that its design may be too rich/complex to be fully understood and justified by society. To me, this seems like a real challenge, and inevitably involves some kind of trade-off between optimization and legitimacy. 

 There is no doubt that embracing such a rich multiverse design will have to go through a series of experiments, artistic explorations, demonstrations, education, and possibly even new technologies of understanding, such as virtual reality simulations. 

 While I have no doubt that this will be a problem, and to some extent achievable, with meaningful constraints, there does not seem to be any reason to abandon the exploration of the multiverse. 

 On the contrary: if you think about the wider possibilities, there is a good chance that some sub-optimal pluralism will emerge, which will have a good user interface, be easy to understand, etc. There are many such precedents in the history of computing technology. 

 Such "human factors" probably deserve the highest attention because they have been studied a lot during the golden age of personal computing and the Internet, rather than being considered an afterthought as in the AI community Ming. But at the same time, they didn't create insurmountable barriers to entry for me. 

 In addition, there are many protocols that seem equally cumbersome and difficult to justify (such as Proof of Stake and many black-box statistical methods) that are not very diverse, but have recently achieved great success and legitimacy. 

 Here, I hope that key questions about legitimacy will continue to be raised as a scalpel to shape pluralism, not as a roadblock to hinder their development. 

 In a sense, I think the multiverse is not just legitimate and compliant, but probably the only reasonable direction for a broad legitimacy and reform vision of the existing underlying social institutions. 

 In retrospect, many of the most critical and transformative moments that define the contemporary political landscape began with plural institutions, which were certainly quite opaque at the time, and were created through competing groups, Born out of mutual compromise and acceptance (e.g. the U.S. Constitution). 

 Given that most publics in liberal democracies embrace some form of pluralism (especially among conservatives and the New Left), and others are devoted to formal rules and technology, the multiverse may be the most A reasonable foundation for integration is also our best hope for achieving major fundamental social changes. 

## OPEN ISSUES

While I think the above reasons give us ample hope that the Multiverse will be able to overcome the challenges it faces, to do so At one point, a lot of development is needed. Some important questions raised by the above discussion include: 

 1. What are the optimal mechanisms in the various models and their parameter settings? In the initial step, how are they parameterized, and how much overlap is there between these parameters? 

2. How would the best or provably near-optimal mechanism for one scenario or model perform in other scenarios or models? Are there designs that work well in multiple contexts? 

3. What computational structures and substrates are required to implement these mechanisms? How can they be decentralized? How to communicate them to users and make them understand? 

4. How to define the best minimum viable experiment for the multiverse? Where can they add the most immediate and identifiable value? 

The basic ideas of these questions are derived from diverse thinking, and answering them will require a range of research fields (such as sociology, economics, computer science, statistics) and practices (such as community organizations, business, blockchain communities) )Participation. However, even great progress in these areas is only the beginning. Many other issues in the development of diversification will obviously follow, and are likely to be outside the horizons of these fields. 

 1. How do the principles of subsidiarity that are flexible, dynamic and adaptive work, and how do they fit into the multi-cooperative mechanisms I highlighted above? 

 2. How does the multiverse go beyond the current quantified systems of power distribution (those I highlighted above), for example, into the field of semiotics, applied to specific advances in communication, semantic construction, cultural capital, representation, etc.? 

3. How can new meaning-making technologies, such as virtual reality, sustain and enhance the multiverse of cultures and institutions? 

## Towards the Multiverse

 In this article, I use the words "pluralism" and "multiverse" almost interchangeably. What I want to stress now is why I think it's necessary to use a separate term: Plurality. 

 I believe that what I have outlined above is not just some kind of political or social philosophy; rather, it constitutes a self-consistent future direction of digital technology, clearly linked to political philosophy. 

 I think this is critical, because today's other major technological directions have underlying, cryptic political values that tend to undermine pluralism. 

 As I have argued elsewhere, the most prominent discourse in the field of AI is the desire for a singularity of "universal" intelligence, which aims to transcend the diversity of human intelligence, with goals "aligned" with human desires Optimization replaces the chaos of multiple cooperation, which is sometimes referred to as "coherent extrapolated volition". 

 Even beyond these most ambitious visions, the focus of AI is on maximizing the autonomy of the system, replicating human capabilities as much as possible, rather than facilitating human-to-human communication and cooperation, which Contrasted with pluralism. Taking the development of general AI as the main/special direction of technological development also contrasts with multiple thinking. 

In this sense, AI is a deeply centralized and unified future technology vision. 

 As I have argued elsewhere, the single most prominent narrative around Web3 looks at liberating "sovereign individuals" from the constraints of social institutions, leveraging "decentralized" protocols, In particular, the distributed ledger serves as the primary neutral base for computation and transactions. 

 These ledgers and concrete, formal, rather narrow cultural, social, and coordinated substrates can be seen as sufficient to satisfy a supreme individual (or in some cases strictly homogeneous) based primarily on the capitalist market interaction between groups). 

 And other forms of social organization, often seen as oppressive “legacy institutions”, are at best ignored and often actively undermined. 

 It places individuals (or at most highly homogeneous communities) as the ultimate "users" rather than auxiliary social networks of closeness and distance; and because it emphasizes the unity of The sufficient necessity of an immutable, immutable ledger is not, as epistemological pluralism, promotes plural technological models. 

 Compared to these two, the development of a “multiverse”—that is, technologies that support pluralism—will require fundamentally different architectures from these, albeit leveraging the tools developed by both paths. 

 It needs to be built closely into the auxiliary tradition that is at the heart of the imagination of the Internet as a "network of networks", where different networks exist in localized physical and organizational (academic, Governments, etc.) communities that agree on interoperable protocols that allow heterogeneous networks connected to each other to interoperate. 

 The “thin protocols” developed in the first wave need to be expanded so that decentralization in the digital realm through social systems such as identity, data sharing, payments, etc. can give a wider range of fundamental rights Empowerment - such as the rights of association, property, and personality. 

 These agreements may use blockchain to achieve certain purposes, but the focus of their decentralization will be localization and auxiliary, as well as networking and interdependence, rather than pure redundancy and prevent attacks. They will need to clearly reflect, represent and accommodate social structures, not just guard against "collusion" or "attack". 

 They need to apply the statistical techniques that underpin machine learning, not just to mirror and replicate the intelligence of individual human beings (for example, through neural-like networks), but as a way of understanding and promoting collective intelligence, allowing groups to achieve rough consensus, while respecting, empowering, and even diffusing ongoing differences (though tools like neural networks are likely to be used in this process). 

 They will need to use VR to build stronger, deeper human connections and creative imaginations to augment the real world to expand, not to escape or build an alternate reality. 

I borrow Tang Feng's poems as a poetic summary: 

> Seeing the "Internet of Everything", we connect our wisdom to the Internet. 
> When we see “internet of things”, let’s make it an internet of beings. 
> When we see “virtual reality”, we will share reality. 
> When we see “virtual reality”, let’s make it a shared reality. 
> When we see “machine learning”, let’s learn together. 
> When we see “machine learning”, let’s make it collaborative learning. 
> When we see “user experience”, we will experience interpersonal relationships. 
> When we see “user experience”, let’s make it about human experience. 
> I heard that the “singularity is approaching” – please don’t forget: “digital” is here. 
> When we hear “the singularity is near”, let us remember: the plurality is here. 

 Such an agenda is undoubtedly quite inspiring. It is more closely aligned with the political traditions of much of the world and with the original aspirations of today's most reputable technologies, such as the personal computer and the Internet, than the major directions in which politics and technology are heading today. It is also politically and technically consistent. 

 Maybe it's not feasible; maybe it's not desirable. Or, it just requires more social forces to cooperate than the other directions; therefore, it comes slightly slower. In the end, with the "true" hope that a multiverse might work, let me end with an imaginary. 

 If this vision is certain, we will have a much brighter future ahead of us than we have been waiting for for decades. We can use digital technologies to create, improve, and develop our social institutions far more than they have so far eroded and destroyed. 

 Taiwan's investment is three orders of magnitude less than the investment in Web3 and AI, but in just a few years, it has used its initial attempts in this direction to develop what can be said to be the most technologically advanced and most advanced technology in the world. A dynamic, democratic society with widely shared growth, less than 1,000 of its 22 million people have died in the pandemic at the time of writing. 

As the scale continues to expand, it also means that the 21st century will become a golden age of civil democracy empowerment and integration. Free more choices and meanings to shape our community. 

 In such a future, the dystopianism of social collapse or the dualism of succumbing to centralized super-AI may have to give way to the cooperative forces hand-in-hand by multiple network topologies. 

 This flower of interdependent, intertwined and cooperative diversity and complexity, this lush rainforest of diverse cultures, is beckoning to us.
