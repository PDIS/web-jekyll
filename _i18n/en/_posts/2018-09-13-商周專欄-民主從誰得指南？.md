The election is near, and more and more discussions are taking place, reminding me of my first vote at the age of 21. 

🗳 That year, a young man near our home resolutely came out to challenge the long-time incumbent. 

 This young friend who is not afraid of the incumbent, the political views are refreshing, let me decide to use the first ticket of this life to support his courage. 

🏆 I didn’t expect that this young man would win with a vote. 

The opponent refused to accept the ticket, but did not change the election results. Therefore, for the first time in the guide, for the first time, there have been new faces. 

 When I saw the data after the election registration deadline, I think that if this friend is now running for election, he may be shocked by the intensity of the election. According to the statistics of the Central Committee, there were nearly 30,000 candidates and more than 10,000 elected candidates, including the mayor of the municipality, the municipal councillor, the lieutenant, the mountain native inhabitant and the district residents. 

 How to find the right person in the vast crowd? 

This is exactly what g0v "[Vote Taiwan Voting Guide](https://councils.g0v.tw/)" project sponsor johnny (luo jincheng) has been thinking about. 

🎲 Johnny said that when he was young, he was confused about the difference between the legislators and the members. The vote was to listen to his mother’s opinion. "It seems to be wasting the hard-won democracy." 

 Out of such doubts Johnny began to organize the relevant public information, and the data and the original code were used for free and open for everyone to work together. 

🔢 Clicking on the voting guide website, in addition to the candidate's political views, including personal property declarations, political contributions, and even the candidates' voting and proposal records during the past tenure, are all at a glance. 

In the 2014 and 2016 elections for the members of the House of Representatives and the legislature elections, Johnny has launched the "Voting Guide", this year is his third launch. After the integration and structure, these precious materials were shared by netizens. In the first two elections, up to 400,000 people were used in the previous month. This shows that the needs of Taiwanese society are extremely high. high. 

It is gratifying that this year's support of the g0v Citizen Science and Technology Innovation Award and the Rushing Citizens Platform has strengthened design and publicity on an existing basis, even for those who are not familiar with citizen technology. Plus use. Their experience of cooperation is undoubtedly another example of social innovation. 

🙋 Johnny said on the website, "If the democratic system is a good system, it must be less."

I think that the voting guide may be the "political resume". . It is like a compass, helping us find a trustworthy candidate, just as I voted for the young chief candidate.
