 As an island on the Pacific Ocean, heavy rain is one of the typical climatic features of Taiwan. Therefore, umbrellas have always been an indispensable item for Taiwanese. 

🥇 An umbrella that is everywhere, was a gold commodity in Taiwan 30 years ago. At the time when the umbrella industry was most prosperous, there were more than 300 umbrella factories in Taiwan. At that time, for every forty people in the world, there was a new umbrella for one person from Taiwan, and the title of "Umbrella Kingdom" was not lost. And go. 

 Today, 30 years later, Taiwan’s umbrella has once again become the focus of the world’s attention. In July this year, the "two fold reverse umbrella" invented by Taoyuan brand "Yi Xin" set a fundraising score of nearly 20 million in 62 days, and won the 2019 German Red Dot Product Design Award in one fell swoop. Kickstarter, the largest fundraising platform in the world, officially entered the international market. 

💡 All this comes from [a meeting in mid-March last year](https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-03-14-%e7%a4%be%e5%89 %b5%e4%b8%ad%e5%bf%83-%e7%ac%ac%e5%8d%81%e4%b8%89%e6%ac%a1-office-hour/%e6%9d%8e %e9%b3%b3%e7%8f%a0). 

🙋 On my routine office hour on Wednesday, Ms. Li Fengzhu, the person in charge of Xinxin, took two umbrellas and walked quickly into my office in the social innovation center. When I sat down, I said incessantly. Start their story. 

🚉 Li Shengqu, the younger brother of Ms. Li and the founder of Yixin, is a senior umbrella maker. When she was on a business trip to Japan more than 10 years ago, she saw the people coming and going at Tokyo Station, and was worried about the rain and was busy collecting umbrellas. The idea is to develop a "reverse umbrella" to allow the umbrella to be received and not wet. 

👷 Master Li did not expect that even if he obtained a patent, he could not stop the counterfeiting. In addition to his ambitions, he chose to continue to improve, and spent ten years, finally it will be difficult to collect the long umbrella in the car, successfully improved into a short and can be folded instantly. 

🤔 Just a short note, how can the new version of the reverse umbrella be named in the dazzling umbrella market without being affected by plagiarism? 

 In this regard, I suggest that they seek public fundraising and tell their own stories. It is not only to establish the brand before the launch of the product, to eliminate the cottage, but also to enable investors to understand the progress of the work, and even provide suggestions for the color, so that more people agree with the concept of the inventor. 

 After a year of preparation, Xinxin officially launched the project in April this year, with a target of raising NT$150,000 in two months. The result was quickly met within 10 minutes. In just two months, he won more than one hundred times of the original target, and eventually raised nearly 20 million Taiwan dollars. 

🌎 "We must use the Taiwanese brand to push it to the world." On the third visit, Ms. Li told me this. The success of fundraising has greatly encouraged them and strengthened their next steps. 

👪 The story of Yi Xin shows me that traditional industries can reproduce the wind through the innovative model of the masses. Looking forward to the future, Taiwan will have more inventors, going global and everywhere.
