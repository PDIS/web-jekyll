 👩🏻‍ 上午 ️ In the morning of December 11th, Shilin District Court held the “Funny Circle” event. The highlight was a mock court held by classmates from Class 9 of Lan Ya Junior High School and colleagues from Shilindi Academy. Act as the judge of this "trial" through real-time distance. 

 ⚖️ In order to let the people understand the justice, and to show how technology can improve the effectiveness of the judicial system, reduce the cost and threshold of using judicial resources, Shihlin Institute combines the off-school teaching of Lan Ya Intermediate School. Through a full day of visits, Interaction and implementation, let students and teachers experience first-hand the feeling of “participating in justice”, and think about “open and transparent justice” and “close to the people ’s justice”. What are the elements? These are exactly the 2017 “Divisional Reforms” China is the goal promoted by the resolution. 

 🏫 Although I participated in the "trial" court, although it is only a simulation, all the details are all in place, which is exactly like the normal court operation. The presiding judge is Judge Jiang Zhewei from Shilindi Court, and the accompanying judge is Mr. Wu from Lan Yaguo Middle School. Through the video robot on the judge's seat and wearing a robe, I am a remote judge. Lan Ya Guozhong's classmates, together with judges from other Shihlin courts, acted as prosecutors, defenders, defendants, informants, witnesses, bailiffs, and so on. 

 💬 Routine judicial procedures such as case statement, cross-examination, reminder testimony, judge review, and sentencing are all carried out step by step. During the two-hour hearing, the actual situation of the court's operation was presented in detail. 

 💻 The review process used the "Sentencing Trend Suggestion System" of the court of justice. Judge Jiang also demonstrated its operation on the spot. Its main function is to integrate the content of tens of thousands of rulings into a database and target different Summarize the crime and the elements. Not only a judge's aid in sentencing, anyone who is curious or has doubts about sentencing can enter relevant parameters on the system, such as the alcohol exhalation concentration of a drunk driving, or the type of transportation. Recommended sentencing reference range. 

 💁 On the basis of this system, my colleagues in the Information Division of the Court of Justice this year teamed up with civilian information experts to participate in this year's "Presidential Cup Hackathon" contest. The new version of the system was produced through artificial intelligence. You can read the ruling directly, and you don't need to input individual parameters to get the sentencing suggestions. This proposal was also selected as one of the outstanding teams this year. 

 🗺 ️ The sentencing information system and the "Funny Circle" activity with the Shilindi Court aims to create a justice that the people are willing to get close to. This is consistent with the concept of "open government", that is, the use of transparency and participation to build mutual trust. And in the process of service design, how to balance justice, quality and efficiency? The answer is in "[Government Digital Services Guidelines](https://www.ndc.gov.tw/content_list.aspx?n=e7f6c261a5f5d9f5)".
