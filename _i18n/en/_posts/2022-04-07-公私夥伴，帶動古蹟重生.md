In recent years, with the joint efforts of the people and the government, many physical monuments have been completely preserved. How to continue to enrich and revitalize the content of historical sites, so that more people can enjoy the style, is the goal of partners from all walks of life. 

Take the "Chiayi Old Prison" established in 1919 as an example: it was listed as a national monument in 2005, and it was opened to the public after restoration. After years of research on the maintenance plan, the old prison in Chiayi has been transformed into the first prison museum, and the second phase of the old prison revitalization and reuse project will be launched this year; Minister of Justice Cai Qingxiang further proposed that through "Open Government - Collaboration" meeting” to brainstorm ideas. 

 However, the operation of the museum is very different from the original business responsibilities of the Correctional Services Department. In addition, the organizational manpower is stretched, and the front-line colleagues feel that they are "more than enough but not enough". Therefore, in the early stage of preparing for the collaboration meeting, we focused on cross-agency exchange of experience and cross-level cognitive alignment to help colleagues in the Corrections Department clarify the direction and take stock of resources. 

 First, we study the experiences of other ministries in establishing museums. For example, when the Ministry of Culture established the National Railway Museum, how did they introduce professional opinions from all parties? How does the National Maritime Science and Technology Museum, which is operated by the Ministry of Education, draw up contracts and operate a public-private partnership model? The National Museum of Indigenous Peoples decided to settle in Kaohsiung Ching Lake, what are the budgeted posts and the exchange plan for the collection of cultural relics? 

In addition to sharing their experience in organizing, the Ministry of Justice's "National Monument Chiayi Old Prison Revitalization and Reuse Team" is also convened by the Director of Corrections and the Deputy Director, and the Department of Comprehensive Planning and the Secretary's Office as the deputy convener , to work together across levels to narrow the distance between imagination and implementation. 

 Next, how to dismantle the original cold and closed image of the prison, and turn it towards an open, close-to-the-people and revitalized direction that integrates the needs of citizens' life? This returns to the "user-centered" design thinking. 

Collaboration meeting is the day, specially selected to be held on Saturday. From long-term residents in the fields, to long-term business and education groups in Chiayi, local and national tourism and travel agency operators, youth, volunteers, cultural and historical experts, and even architectural landscape experts and colleagues from Chiayi City Government, gathered in Chiayi Old Town. The prison campus, while talking about desire, also contributes resources. 

Through the morning tour, you can learn about the historical context and the limitations of the use of cultural resources; in the afternoon discussion, you will start from your own concerns and visions, and jointly create specific suggestions for revitalization and reuse. Netizens who participated online also actively provided valuable opinions. 

This collaborative meeting not only promotes the integration of historic sites into community life, but is also a wonderful demonstration of civic cooperation. Looking forward to the new look of the old Chiayi Prison, a national historic site, with the continuous cooperation of colleagues in the public sector and friends from all over the country, it can take root locally and advance internationally.
