A few days ago, I joined colleagues from the Industrial Development Bureau in visiting a renowned oyster noodles restaurant in Banqiao, New Taipei City, to better understand the application of the [Taiwan Cloud Marketplace]((https://www.tcloud.gov.tw/)) platform. With a rich history spanning 36 years, this eatery has transformed from a roadside stall to a well-established diner. The aroma of steaming noodles coupled with the rich taste of plump oysters left an indelible mark.

The owner told me that daily preparations begin as early as 6 a.m., with the doors opening to customers by 9:30 a.m. and closing at 7 p.m. Well-trained staff ensure the steady flow of patrons moves smoothly, with each customer served within an average of five minutes, from ordering to checkout.

But juggling in-person orders, phone reservations, takeout requests and catering to customized demands such as "no coriander" proved challenging with just pen and paper. Miscommunications and errors were frequent.

This challenge found its solution through the Taiwan Cloud Marketplace platform initiated by the Ministry of Digital Affairs. This one-stop platform integrates processes across various governmental departments and offers a curated selection of cloud tools tailored for small and medium enterprises.

Any entity meeting the SME criteria or with a registered tax business can effortlessly complete the entire application, review, and contract processes within a mere 10 minutes on the platform. They can then embark on their digital transformation journey, even availing up to 30,000 units in digital subsidies. For those uncertain about which tools to opt for, online expert consultations are available.

With the help of the Taiwan Cloud Marketplace, the restaurant integrated the Quick Point Line Ordering Customer Service System, facilitating 24-hour online ordering and payment for their customers.

This digital transition eliminated the need for phone orders, saving approximately three minutes of verbal confirmation per order. Not only did this alleviate the workload for the on-site team, but it also streamlined the ordering process and minimized errors. Moreover, the online ordering system tapped into a broader customer base, doubling the average purchase value per customer. Additionally, data analytics assisted in inventory management, optimizing procurement costs.

The restaurantâ€™s success underscores the significance of subscription-based, data-portable cloud services as essential digital transformation tools for SMEs. Apart from aiding enterprises through the Cloud Marketplace, the government also encourages continuous innovation among IT service providers with the Digital Cloud Service Themed R&D Subsidy Program.

Currently, the Taiwan Cloud Marketplace offers a plethora of solutions in categories like online store setup, marketing promotion, remote work, enterprise management, customer service, and market analysis. As of this November, over 36,000 enterprises have embraced these solutions.

Different industries have varied operational goals. The moda remains committed to assisting all, ensuring that every meticulously crafted service and product effortlessly reaches its intended audience.
