Hello local time everyone. I am Tang Feng, a Taiwanese digital minister and the chairman of the National Information Security Research Institute. 

It is a great honor for me to deliver a keynote speech at SITRA’s online event. This gathering of forward-thinking minds is particularly important because it coincides with the International Day of Democracy – a perfect opportunity to redouble our efforts to deliver empathetic, effective and responsive governance for all. . 

There is no doubt that democracy is facing unprecedented challenges from authoritarians who seek to use AI to undermine and weaken our free and open societies. These operations come in many forms, but the most sinister ones directly target our foundations of trust, tainting social platforms founded on Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights – the right to freedom of speech and expression. 

In 2016, we witnessed a turning point in public communications. The venerable Associated Press style guide has announced that the word "Internet" will no longer be capitalized, symbolizing its universal use. Unfortunately, the ubiquity of the Internet has also opened up a way for industries that specialize in manipulating people's hearts to collect personal information on a large scale and subvert privacy practices, driving many people into extreme isolation. This year’s fully interactive deepfake videos have further tainted online interactions, opening the door to unprecedented large-scale fraud and manipulation. 

So, democracy is at a low ebb. Authoritarianism rises, using elaborate censorship and electronic systems for surveillance. In fact, global online freedom has been declining for 12 consecutive years. Today, only one billion people live under the aegis of democracy, while more than twice that number struggle under authoritarian rule. 

As the saying goes, there are always two sides to a coin. While some emerging technologies benefit authoritarian regimes, others can be used to revitalize democracies. What are the most effective solutions to combat online harm? The answer lies in "Plurality," which is technology that promotes diverse collaboration to increase the bandwidth of democracy. Polis is a great example of this spirit. 

Taiwan began working with Polis in 2015, just as Uber and sharing economy startups were taking the world by storm. The pursuit of innovation and profit conflicts with the livelihood of taxi drivers, triggering legal proceedings and struggles. This conflict is equally fierce in Taiwan. Fortunately, we have Polis to trace the development path and extract common wisdom from the fierce online debate. 

The genius of Polis is that participants and opinions are all on the same page, visually displaying the degree to which each group is divided. Although his initial opinions were quite extreme, Polis was always able to promote common viewpoints and bridge differences. Polis not only provides a visual mapping of democratic opinion inputs, but also produces interactive reports that are updated in real time. 

Such applications cover a variety of issues with international impact. Taiwan has twice worked with democracies like Finland through Polis. The first came as trade tensions were rising in 2019, when there were concerns that Taiwan would be drawn into the dispute and excluded from economic integration. Through the "AIT@40 Digital Dialogue", we gathered ideas on how to increase defense, economic, and people-to-people exchanges between Taiwan and the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, which were quickly implemented by both Taiwan and the United States. 

In 2020, Taiwan explored various epidemic prevention measures such as privacy-protecting contact tracing, and once again received active global participation. It’s important to note that this isn’t limited to Polis opinion polls—we work together to create solutions. After identifying which solutions meet social values, citizen hackers around the world implement these ideas through hackathons. 

This year, Taiwan takes Polis to a whole new level. In response to the rapid popularity of AI, the Digital Department has joined the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP.org) and launched the "Alignment Assemblies" (https://cip.org/alignmentassemblies). Other partners include OpenAI, Anthropic, GovLab, and the GETTING-Plurality Research Network. Our goal is to give everyone the opportunity to contribute to AI safety and sustainability, as well as to identify and mitigate the risks posed by this emerging technology. 

In July of this year, we used Polis to co-create with everyone to explore the issue of AI’s future democratization and set the agenda for face-to-face deliberation workshops in August and September. The records will soon be released as open material to train AI language models that fit Taiwan’s unique experience. 

In order to ensure that the alignment conference can present real voices, polis.tw (maintained by the PDIS team of the Information Security Institute) has added two new functions. First, we extended Polis to integrate a trusted external login system to ensure participant authenticity. 

In addition, with the assistance of the AI Objectives Institute, the "[Talktothe](https://www.talktothe.city/)" website shown here provides real-time AI-assisted summary, translation and interaction. This chat room empowers everyone to have nuanced conversations with diverse opinion groups, deepening cross-cultural understanding and empathy. 

Now, look at [this picture](https://talk.polis.tw/) - each dot represents an opinion, shining like stars on the dark background. The overall reflection forms a constellation that provides direction for alignment issues. For many participants, this was their first interaction with AI in a deliberative context. This is not an individual conversation, but an evolving collective discussion with the common good in mind. 

When it comes to AI governance, Taiwan firmly believes that a democratic model—rather than a purely technical approach—is the best answer to difficult ethical and political questions affecting the world. In practice, experts cannot foresee all application scenarios and impacts. As with climate change, we need comprehensive statistics to understand the possible damage, including overdependence, emotional impact, and information manipulation. 

Unlike climate change, interactions with AI are extremely personal. All metrics must be shared in a highly privacy-protective manner. The safest way to operate is to form a coalition of data holders and researchers, through a trustworthy data charity operator, to ensure that non-personal data about harm and preferences are processed and aggregated securely. 

Thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-enhancing technologies, and a GDPR-compliant version of Polis driven by SITRA, a global Alignment Conference is entirely possible. One step at a time, let’s build consensus on the boundaries of AI applications and lead its continued development so that local, connected gatherings can provide clear guidance for their respective political and regulatory environments. 

Finally, I sincerely invite everyone to participate in the Polis dialogue at scale and use groundbreaking initiatives in the field of collective intelligence to mitigate social risks while safeguarding human rights and democracy so that future generations can also benefit. Through the cooperation, curiosity, courage and vision of all people, we can chart a sustainable deliberative path for global governance and create an infinite future. 

Thank you for listening, and I wish SITRA success in this exciting online event, and may everyone continue to live and prosper!
