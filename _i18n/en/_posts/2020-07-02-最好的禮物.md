🎁 With the gradual implementation of the "new life of epidemic prevention", the streets began to restore the crowds of the past, whether it is the prosperity or mood, are quickly returning to the temperature, and smiles can be seen everywhere in shops and restaurants. Friends who don't divide the industry, government, research institutes, during this period of time have always tried their best to make these smiles more open through a series of revitalization measures. 

♻️ Among them, the creativity and intentions of many social innovation organizations have opened my eyes. For example, Renzhou Social Enterprise, which is committed to the protection of ecology and circular economy and is committed to the development of net plastic products, has recently cooperated with China Airlines to develop an environmental protection accompanying cup. In addition to creating new business opportunities for the aviation industry affected by the epidemic, it is also ingenious It connects green consumption with the concept of "bring your own tableware". 

🚸 In addition to cooperative research and development of products, social innovation organizations have also developed new cooperation models with the industry. For example, the Victory Foundation and the Family Convenience Store have launched the first "Commonwealth Social Enterprise Partner Store" to help charitable organizations get out of the impact of the epidemic. In addition, I can gradually transform into a self-sufficient social enterprise, so that the mission can be inherited forever. 

👩‍⚕️ Apart from taking care of themselves, there are also social innovation organizations directly involved in epidemic prevention work. In the past, Daai Sewing Production Cooperative, which mainly produces cultural and creative products and handmade cloth bags, received an order for medical isolation clothes this year. This group of members who rebuilt their lives through cooperatives after the Morakot storm is still rushing to work for the epidemic prevention staff. 

🎪 The experience of loving sewing makes many social creation organizations start to think: How to warm the society more widely? 

💝 Therefore, under the call of the Small and Medium Business Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, nearly thirty organizations selected for this year's Buying Power Co., Ltd. worked together to launch the "Power Taiwan Warm Heart Ritual", from washing supplies to mask sets Each gift is the true intention of the social creation partners. Among them, the gift box packaging is more special in cooperation with Hsinchu's "Slow Flying Children Refuge Factory", which are all hand-made by people with disabilities. 

🌏 Since six months, the global industrial development and life style have changed dramatically, and it is still unrest. These social creation partners let us see: How to walk out of a different path for yourself with flexibility and resilience when the accident suddenly comes, and also let the public see new possibilities. 

🧧 Inspired by the physical actions of these friends, in addition to the "three-fold revitalization coupon" that went on the road in July, in addition to the purchase of three thousand yuan of social creation products, I will also use the digital full reward of two thousand yuan. Love donates to charity groups through donation codes. It is hoped that through diversified payment methods and channels of use, people who are interested can contribute to their strength and those who love can be more forgiving.
