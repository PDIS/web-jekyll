 As the home of 23 million people, maintaining national security has always been the common expectation of all the people, and it is the goal of hard work. What is different from the past is that today, we have more opportunities to discuss national security issues and make contributions: for example, to participate in the “intelligence and harmony – digital dialogue” ([TalkTo.AIT.org.tw]( https://talkto.ait.org.tw/) ). 

📲 “Digital Dialogue” was launched by the American Association of Taiwanese (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and my office (PDI). A series of online public consultations will focus on "improving Taiwan's role in the global community" and "improving US-Taiwan economic and commercial relations" in the fourth, sixth, eighth and November of this year. "Safe cooperation" and the next four issues of "promoting the relationship between the people of the United States and Taiwan" have publicly sought advice from the public. In other words, if you want to know why Taiwan needs to purchase the latest "F-16V" fighters from the United States, or the most powerful chariot "M1A2" on the surface, how much self-defense ability can be added, and we How should we cooperate with the United States in order to strengthen its own defense industry? Any discussion about security cooperation between Taiwan and the United States is what we are asking for. 

🇺🇸 For a long time, the United States has been Taiwan’s most important ally and partner in the security field. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was supported and passed by the US Congress's cross-party. It was clearly stated that the US government should provide "defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities." This has ensured that the United States supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining its own self-defense capabilities and also consolidates its security. 

 Since 2008, the US government has sold more than US$24 billion to Taiwan, and the amount and projects that Chinese governments have purchased from the US military are regarded as extremely important indicators for measuring the ups and downs of bilateral relations. . Today, in addition to observing and commenting on this national event, the "digital dialogue" has also given everyone a rare opportunity to participate in the actual situation. Finally, we also share a message in advance: After the four major issues of the "Digital Dialogue" are behind, the relevant US units and organizations will continue to take the "Development of Talents Major Alliance Program" as the main axis and start a new phase. Digital dialogue, please wait and see.
