 ü§π Democracy is dynamic and full of vitality, but like juggling artists tossing and receiving the ball, it needs a high degree of balance to prevent the flying colored balls from falling. On one side of the moment is state power, with huge resources and organizations, but the justification of governance is needed; on the other side is the people who claim to be the masters, who have the ultimate power, but there is always a lot of noise, so we face a dilemma: expecting the government to be able, but I don't want the escape to take hold; I expect the society to be pluralistic, but I don't want to achieve nothing. 

 ‚öñÔ∏è Contemporary constitutionalism, on the one hand, checks and balances each other through the separation of powers, on the other hand, it uses parliamentary politics and media freedom to ensure diverse opinions but can unite public will. Democracy relies on these mechanisms to build mutual trust and let the ball fly in the air. Won't land. 

 üì¢ In this trust mechanism, freedom of speech is undoubtedly an important cornerstone, and speech must be transparent and true. The harm of wrong messages is obvious, and it is easier to say the wrong thing or lie than to tell the truth, otherwise there will be no saying "A lie can travel half while the truth is still wearing shoes." way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. "). 

 üì∞ Traditionally, we have relied on Congress and the media as gatekeepers to maintain the delicate balance of this ecosystem. 

 üåê The emergence of the Internet has brought about tremendous changes. Receiving information, expressing opinions and even mobilizing the masses, there is no need to pass through the Congress or the media. Everyone can be a public opinion representative or the media. (Hashtag) can roll up a thousand piles of snow. The already fragile mutual trust is in jeopardy. Unorganized messages that are organized and planned to operate are even more intrusive-using social media information overload, opaque algorithms and other weaknesses, fake messages can be quickly transmitted, and similar content can be continuously fed to strengthen both Opinions are formed, stratospheres are formed, the network speech environment is increasingly clear, barriers to mutual trust are increasingly weak, power imbalances and trust collapse, and democracies are scattered. 

 üí• The spread of false information has become the Achilles tendon of whether democracy can be well governed. The intuitive response is to protect it through legal control. Singapore passed the "Preventing Untruthful Information and Internet Manipulation Act" ( Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act), which gives the government the power to order individuals or the media to remove false messages; the other is typically NetzDG in Germany, which requires major social media to self-censor and prevent the disclosure and make it public. But if the power of delisting is handed over to the executive, wouldn't the front door refuse the tiger and the back door welcome the wolf? It would not be better to be a lingering multinational company. Even if it is entrusted to machine computing, the lack of transparency and checks and balances in business operations and algorithms is more powerful than state power. As a person who maintains its value, it must not be unconscious. alert. 

 üîî The ringer must also be the person who answers the bell. Since the problem comes from the transfer of information from the media to the community, the civil society can only participate in the reconstruction of trust, and it is empowered to the community that anyone can enter and leave at any time. The risk of abuse due to concentration of power is minimal. 

 üìß Actually, we do n‚Äôt lack similar experience. Once spam flooded in every mailbox, it almost formed a doomsday crisis of e-mail, but its redemption does not come from strong legislative control, but in the social Under the group initiative, mail service providers provide users with the right to mark spam. The spam marked by everyone is intercepted by the system to another inbox, but no message is deleted. If it is considered useful information, it can still be found. , And marked as white mail-power will not be concentrated on any person or business, users still retain their autonomy! 

 üíä Taiwan ‚Äôs approach to counterfeit messages is similar, and it does not rely on legal control. Instead, it urges major social media or information tool companies such as Facebook, LINE, and Google to jointly sign self-regulatory practice guidelines, in addition to establishing technical standards. In addition to protection, enhancing advertising transparency and management, and enhancing user reading ability, it is important to work with third parties to build an independent, transparent, and fair supervision mechanism. 

 üî¨ Taiwan ‚Äôs third-party fact-checking mechanisms, such as the "Taiwan Fact-Checking Center", "Cofacts are real and fake", "MyGoPen" and "Rum Toast" are all private independent organizations, even without fixed members It is conceivable that there is a shortage of human capital. Open citizen participation is also inevitable. Many technical development and fact-finding work are done with the input of volunteers that everyone can participate in. Citizen participation allows friends in these social sectors to stay within reach while working together with the government and enterprises, and maintain internal checks and balances. 

 üìñ The same citizen-centric logic is also used in [Media Literacy Teaching](https://mlearn.moe.gov.tw/). Rather than teaching people or students how to distinguish the tide-like information on the Internet dogmatically, let everyone know that everyone on the Internet can be a media. As a possible self-media worker, they will understand the message more deeply than any audience. Whether it is true or false or not. 

 üî¢ The huge organizations and resources owned by the government provide real-time, correct and easy-to-understand information to the public, and also allow third parties to check it. The Executive Yuan uses the "2-2-2 principle" to expect that all ministries will clarify immediately: 2 hours, within 200 words, 2 pictures (mostly completed within one hour after the disclosure of false information). 

 ü§£ Of course, "fun" is also very important, ** meme project **-"try to pack the message into a form that can't help but want to share", so that the correct message can be spread more quickly. When the false message just leaves the front foot, the correct message follows the heel, and it is also bright and bright. Maybe you can catch up without walking half the earth. 

 üåà The 2019 United Nations Secretary-General's High-level Digital Cooperation Expert Group Meeting released the "Digital Interdependence Declaration", emphasizing the establishment of a decentralized joint governance structure ("COGOV"). To reconstruct the democratic ecosystem in the digital age, we must change the check-and-balance relationship between the government and the people into a triangular relationship in which the government, enterprises, and people work together and rely on each other. The ecological balance required by a democratic society allows colored balls to have enough kinetic energy to fly smoothly in the air.
