 During the UN General Assembly in September this year, I met a friend in New York who can almost be described as "legend". 

👩 Her name is Mariéme Jamme, the founder of the British iamtheCODE organization, a social enterprise that supports young women in learning programming. 

⛈ Why does Mariéme set up this organization? She was born in the countryside of Senegal. When she was 13 years old, she was smuggled into Paris by a trafficker and was sexually exploited. When she was 15 years old, she was arrested by the police. Because she did not have the opportunity to receive education, she could hardly read or write until she was 16 years old, and she could only do low-level labor work to survive. 

📖 She didn’t want to surrender to her fate. When she had a gap, she was soaked in a public library, backed by a dictionary, reading an encyclopedia, and even self-study spreadsheets and programming languages. Step by step, today, I also got a cover. Affirmation of the Foundation's and UNICEF's annual Innovation Awards. 

 In 2016, she founded iamtheCODE, which is to help more girls like her, to regain the dominance of life from the doom. 

👓 Mariéme tells me a little story. This year, when she was holding a hackathon in Liverpool, England, she came to a young girl who always wears glasses and doesn't say a word. When Mariéme talked with her, she found out that she had been bullied because of her gender identity. This shy girl, who succeeded in developing a community-assisted platform for anti-bullying in two days and 24 hours of hackathon, established self-affirmation and resistance to bullying in combination with other children who did not seem to be "mainstream." 

🏡 This little story reminds me of the "Social Enterprise World Forum" conference in Edinburgh in early September. There are also two similar cases. 

The founder of Solar Ear, Howard Weinstein, started in Africa to develop solar-powered hearing aids and hired hearing impaired people to lead the production process and produce equipment that suits their needs; MIT Lab and Baan Dek Foundation The Digital Superhero Academy (DSHA) saw the vulnerable children in South Asia, lacked critical thinking and social stimulation of their own situation, and developed an interactive textbook with local social workers so that children can learn quickly. Practical life skills. 

 I think, these stories all reflect the connotation of "appropriate technology": not to use "advanced and innovative technology" to "save" people who need help, but to let the other party "master" the tools, from Start with your own needs and make your life better. Just like Mariéme learned the spreadsheet and programming language, he changed his life in time. 

🌍 "Our goal is to train one million female programmers in developing countries such as Africa, the Middle East and South America by 2030," Mariéme said firmly. I believe that the shy girl must be one of them.
