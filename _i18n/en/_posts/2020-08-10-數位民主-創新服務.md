🤖 In many speeches, a question is often asked: "Will AI replace human work?"

🚸 AI to me is "Assistive Intelligence", which is to assist humans wisdom. What AI replaces is what we are not suitable to do or do not want to do, so that humans can engage in more creative work and obtain spiritual satisfaction. 

🚵 We develop technology to meet the needs of everyone. Even if there are things that are both regular and better with machines, as long as people can get a sense of accomplishment and fun from them, of course they will not be replaced by machines. For example, friends who love outdoor activities will definitely not let machines run and climb mountains instead of us, even if machines run faster and climb higher. 

📖 "Technology always comes from human nature", the space for public digital innovation also comes from human nature. How to strike a balance and dialogue between human nature and technology? This is a subject that TEG (Electronic Governance Research Center) has cultivated for many years. In the "[Digital Transformation of Government](https://www.wunan.com.tw/bookdetail?no=14943)" this must-read introductory book, Provide a complete and systematic response. 

🔖 I think that this book uses "Digital Democracy" as the leading chapter, which is indeed insightful and probing, because the core concept of "digital transformation" contained in the current "service-oriented smart government" is precisely here. . 

🔔 Before 2016, the "Electronic Government Project" at various stages still focused on "how the government optimizes services" when constructing information and communication equipment and developing innovative governance. In the brand new stage starting in 2017, the core concepts of “data governance, open collaboration, and citizen participation” have been highlighted for the first time in order to create a cross-departmental and diverse collaboration environment. So far, digital services not only come from human nature, but also from the concrete practice of democracy. 

🗽 The meaning of "digital democracy" not only uses tools such as social media, online signatures, and electronic voting to reflect public opinion and exercise civil rights; it also lies in the digital services provided by the government, from development to deployment. Take democracy as the prerequisite. In other words, government digital services must be "citizen-centered," that is, "open the door to build a car," and find the people to design together. 

🌁 However, in this age of "one person with one trumpet, each with his own tune", digital services must emphasize democracy. Isn't it too idealistic? And the public opinion is like water, where to find a consensus, will it not fall into the predicament of father and son riding a donkey? 

🌼 The meaning of democracy, of course, does not mean that everything has to be voted on. It can only seek common ground, not differences. The important thing is to create a space for co-creation through dialogue, so that even if the stakeholders of all parties have different goals, they can do something together. Although the result is not to everyone's satisfaction, everyone can live it well. 

⛰️ For example, there are hundreds of mountain climbers, and their needs are also various, but for the "[Taiwan Mountaineering Application One-stop Service Network](https://hike.taiwan. gov.tw/)", during the discussion of "Salute to the Mountain" in 2019, everyone agreed: three agencies and four different online application systems. It is too troublesome to register separately once you climb the mountain. 

🙋 The solution is not to knock down and retrain. Different agencies have their own duties and management purposes. Therefore, under the premise of uninterrupted existing services, PDIS (Public Digital Innovation Space Group of the Executive Yuan), colleagues from relevant authorities, and several young people who are interested in improving the design of government websites My friend, adopted the method of "consistent front-end and integrated back-end" to create a new digital service. And friends who have expressed different opinions in the collaboration meeting are logically the best candidates to participate in the preliminary use test. 

🌄 It can be seen that "father and son riding a donkey" is not necessarily unsolvable. If all parties have common values, that is, "the most important thing is to complete the journey safely," then it is not necessary to take turns to ride the donkey. Maybe there are passers-by who are willing to provide shared rides and free rides. The point is that "democracy" is not the pursuit of a single solution that everyone must agree to. Rather than wanting a rough consensus, it is better to have a rough consensus, so that everyone can go on together. Rather than the government "being the king and the teacher" and insisting everyone accept the so-called advanced technology, it is better to find out what is lacking now? When the government can do it and the people can accept it, digital services will be realized bit by bit. 

🌱 I am often asked by my business colleagues, will it be inefficient? Based on my experience working in Silicon Valley, the first step in building an ecosystem is to admit that I am not a panacea. This is especially important for public services: the so-called "cooperation" does not mean that everything is government-led. If there are more suitable social innovation organizations, why not let them do it? The government only needs to fully support it. 

🗺️ For example, the "Mask Real-Name System" in early 2020. With the assistance of a pharmacist, a health insurance card is used to purchase masks. What people want to know most is "Where are the health insurance pharmacies? How many masks are there?" Colleagues of the department adopted the strategy of "opening doors and making cars", publishing the stock of masks on the government's open information platform, and contacting friends who originally wrote the "supermarket mask map" to collaborate on development. 

📈 Thanks to the contributions of the g0v (zero-time government) community partners, within 72 hours, there have been a variety of applications such as maps and chatbots. The policy has been on the road for a week, and the "mask supply and demand information platform" has hundreds of applications of all kinds, which is definitely much more efficient than the past "closed door". 

🌐 It can be seen that digital government services can not only evolve from "for the people" to "with the people", but can also achieve the ideal of "after the people"-this is exactly what I served as a digital executive in the Executive Yuan. The original intention of the political commissar: to promote citizen participation and increase social innovation. 

💡 Here, I hope that all readers of "The Digital Transformation of Government" can give full play to the social innovation spirit of "Everyone's business, and all help", and work together to practice digital democracy. It is for the order.
