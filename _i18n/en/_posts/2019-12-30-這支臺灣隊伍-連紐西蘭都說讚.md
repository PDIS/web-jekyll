 🏡 In the middle of this month, I was invited to attend the “Homeland Wisdom Patrol Team”, one of the top ten teams in this year ’s “Presidential Cup Hackathon”, and held a presentation conference with the Lightning Lab of New Zealand to learn about the “Homeland Wisdom Patrol” How to "guard the team" in just one week, with the assistance of two senior consultants from Lightning Lab (Mentor), to review and strengthen [Water Box](https://issuu.com/pdis. tw / docs / friday_wrap-up_presentation _-_ water_box) This innovative application scenario and possible business models. 

 🇳🇿 Also present were representatives of the New Zealand Commercial and Industrial Office. Both the two experienced consultants and the senior diplomats of New Zealand gave high praise to the achievements of the "Homeland Patrol Team". 

 🌾 The members of the "Homeland Wisdom Patrol Team" are from the National Taipei University of Science and Technology, the Textile Industry Comprehensive Research Institute, the 事务所 Environmental Technologists' Office, Heshuo United Technology Co., Germany's Ge-Komm Company and Taiwan's ECOCEO Open. group. They continued the concept and practice of the internationally renowned citizen technology success case "Air Box" to create a "Water Box" with reasonable cost and wide deployment. In the future, the "Water Box" will automatically collect data such as water quality, water volume, and the changing cycle of the hydrological environment, hoping to strengthen the prediction, prevention, and control of various pollution sources, thereby reducing the negative impact on agricultural water use. 

 💯 Coincidentally, there is another important water-related innovation in China in the near future, that is, "[山河 事 事件](https://riverlog.lass-net.org/)" has been awarded IoT Data Application Contest ". 

 🏞️ The Mountain and River Event Book adheres to the spirit of open source and self-made, compiling open data on hydrology, climate, and hydrology of the public Internet of People's Livelihood. Through visual icons, it presents the dynamics of water elephants throughout Taiwan, and cares about the water level. Changing people can query the rainfall, water level, tidal level and operation status of pumping stations in various regions, and use satellite data and other information sources for preliminary analysis to help understand the circumstances and causes of flooding events. 

 🏆 Whether it is the "President's Cup hack loose" or the "People's Livelihood Public IoT Data Application Contest", we have discovered that the master is in the folk. In my opinion, the limited government resources and endless civil power, through the partnership of citizens in data governance, to solve specific social problems and promote global sustainable development are in itself a very valuable innovation that deserves praise from people.
