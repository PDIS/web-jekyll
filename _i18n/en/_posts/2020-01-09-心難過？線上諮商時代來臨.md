 ⚕️ In recent years, mental health has become an area of public concern. No matter the community resources on the Internet or the consulting services provided by professional psychologists, it has become commonplace. 

 👩‍⚕️ Thankfully, starting this year, you can consult without going out. In December of last year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced the Principles for Psychologists' Implementation of Psychological Counseling for Communication. The plans proposed by medical institutions, psychological treatment clinics, and psychological counseling offices can be implemented after approval by local authorities. In other words, as long as the agency is licensed, consultations can be conducted wherever the case is. 

 🎨 All of this originated in 2017. The National Development Council proactively proposed a regulation adjustment case of "physicians and psychologists providing services through the Internet platform" on the private vTaiwan platform. The platform solicited included psychologists and lawyers. Consult with the public and other parties to take stock of regulations and adjust their directions. 

 🗃️ Based on the discussions in the vTaiwan community, in May 2018, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced the "Communication Diagnosis and Treatment Measures", which first relaxed the care targets and models of telemedicine. At the same time, the psychologist's research and development of laws and regulations continues through the "Innovation and Regulations Sandbox Platform" of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. 

 👨‍⚕️ For example, the Psychologists Law stipulates that “the practice of a psychologist must be limited to one place”, but it does not limit the location of the case. In this regard, the consultative psychologists and clinical psychologists associations, as well as relevant online platforms and communities, also provide precautions according to their own professions, so that long-distance consultations can be safe, reliable, and effective in addition to complying with regulations. To protect the rights and interests of participants. 

 🇫🇷 In my personal experience, distance as a supplement to the meeting really has quite good results. From 2012 until the beginning of 2017, I worked with French psychologists in a semi-proximal and semi-distant manner, and met physically every six months, and the rest of the time was via a web video conversation four days a week for 45 minutes each time. . 

 💺 The method of classical psychoanalysis is that one person lays on a bench, speaks what he thinks, and the other listens intently. Although this method is different from psychological counseling, it still has similarities. For me, being able to continue to share with professional listeners is a very healing process. The most important thing is how to achieve the "common presence" feeling through remote connection. 

 💝 Through the vTaiwan platform and sandbox mechanism, all stakeholders “from conversation to dialogue” together to accomplish a very important thing for this era: no matter where they are, everyone can find a profession that they can talk to Counselors take their mental health seriously.
