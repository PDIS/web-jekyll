On October 21st, I participated in the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand in Bangkok, co-organized with the School of Communication Arts of Chulalongkorn University and the German Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF). "Conference on Social Innovation and Civic Participation". In addition to the "Open Government Liaison" of the National Development Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Engineering Association, the representatives of the company also have representatives of the company, Cofacts "true and false" project co-founder Johnson, and "Meteorological Master" Dr. Peng Qiming . 

 It is worth noting that the main contents of this seminar include Taiwan's promotion of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the use of open materials to improve the quality of life, countering false information on the Internet, and expanding public policy citizen participation. Etc. Each is the result of a collaborative effort between the government, the business, and the citizen community. In other words, the focus of the discussion is not only "what we did," but also "how do we do it together." 

 Taking social innovation as an example, I shared the history of the establishment of the Social Innovation Center; the social issues dealt with by the outstanding team of the Presidential Cup hackathon in the past two years, and the sustainable development goals implemented; through the establishment of a fixed Office Hour Organize a tour to minimize the gap between urban and rural information; and how to instantly grasp and respond to the difficulties encountered by social innovation friends through social innovation platforms, so that social innovation can drive regulatory innovation. 

 In addition, under the arrangement of the representative office, I also received intensive interviews from the public television stations in Thailand, Chulalongkorn University, A DAY, Post Today and Workpoint. It is obvious that Taiwan's relevant practical experience has indeed received great attention from all walks of life in Thailand. 

 The part of citizen participation is briefed by the Chief of the Public Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Qian Muxian, and the Special Committee of the Engineering Committee, Zhang Zhaoqi. Opening the four elements of the open government, "Transparency, Participation, Responsibility, and Connotation", explaining the functions of the China Development Council's Public Policy Network Participation Platform (JOIN) and the way in which the inter-departmental government will open the government liaison system. Take the example of "Requesting the Air Traffic Corps of the Ministry of the Interior to be stationed at Hengchun Airport" and "Don't use the tax filing software to explode" as an example to introduce the inter-departmental opening of government liaisons and business units, and how to clarify the core demands of the sponsors. Interview with a variety of stakeholders to collect weekly opinions; invite service users to join the collaboration and participate in the actual planning; complete the process of the meeting and open specific responses to find a feasible and innovative solution. 

üåè "Taiwan Can Help" is the core appeal of the government in recent years. This is not just a slogan, but a real experience and resources that can contribute to the international. I am very pleased to be assisted by all walks of life, this Bangkok trip, let us have another chance to prove: Taiwan Can Help.
