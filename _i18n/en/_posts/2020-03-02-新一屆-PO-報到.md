 🙋 PO is the abbreviation of "Participation Officer" of the Inter-Ministerial Council of the Executive Yuan. Just like the "Congressional Liaison" who has been in charge in the past for coordinating with legislators, the "Media Liaison" is responsible for communicating with the media, based on ["Executive Points for the Opening of Government Liaison by the Executive Yuan and Its Subsidiaries"](https: / /po.pdis.nat.gov.tw/ 
): 

 📲 "Each government should fully consider the basic principles of open government such as transparency, participation, accountability, and tolerance in the process of promoting policy formation. For complex issues, divergent opinions, or enthusiastic public participation, open government liaisons should assist the heads of the agencies in assessing whether appropriate procedures should be practiced in the early stages of policy planning in accordance with the principles of open government. " The core function of the PO is to become a bridge for communication between the government and the people at an appropriate time. The biggest challenge also arises because "not specific" means that the communication mode must be tailored to the case and cannot be restricted to one-and-a-half methods; and "multiple" means that it is more difficult to integrate and balance opinions. Therefore, how to design a good mechanism so that all parties can listen to each other calmly is the biggest challenge of being a PO. 

 📅 According to the Essentials, the ministries "should assign at least one person of the appropriate level and sufficient authority to act as an open government liaison." Therefore, starting from 2017, each beginning of the year will become the point of registration for the new session of the PO (including initial and renewal). In addition, with the expansion and deepening of the open government business, more and more third-level organs of the ministry will also assign special personnel to serve as POs. After all, when discussing many issues, the department, department, bureau, and department levels serve as windows, which can better meet the key and shorten the communication process. 

 ✍️ This year's new PO has another task that is different from the past, that is, assisting the affiliated ministries to plan "[National Action Plan (NAP)](https: // www.ndc.gov.tw/content_list.aspx?n=0c5ab1d0fa5b64b8&upn=97ad5aa9359cab38). " 

 👍 Under the leadership of Chairman Chen Meiling of the National Development Council, various ministries have taken stock of "maximizing open data value-added applications", "expanding public participation in public policy mechanisms", "increasing gender and ethnic inclusion dialogue", " Implementation of the five major commitments such as clean governance, implementation of money laundering and prevention, and public opinion consultation on the Join public platform, demonstrating the determination to continue to promote open government, and actively participating in the international organization, the Open Government Partnership Alliance Partnership, OGP). 

 🚸 Of course, the focus of an open government does not end with the government's unilateral commitment, but also with the dialogue, mutual trust, and cooperation between the government and the people. It is more important for the government and the people to move forward together than to make two separate steps on either side.
