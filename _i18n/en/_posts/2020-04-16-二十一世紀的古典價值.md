 Two years ago, Glen Weyl and Eric Posner co-authored "Radical Markets (Radical Markets)", which caused extensive discussion and repercussions. Glen and Eric believe that in the face of public affairs, people often hold their own opinions and are reluctant to share information that only they know. If a well-designed market mechanism can be used to encourage more people to express their true ideas publicly, society can work together to find a better solution. 

 Based on the idea of "promoting public interest through market mechanisms", they selected five social issues in different fields and designed five proposals through mechanism design. Nowadays, this book is launched in Chinese, and I think it is really meaningful for Taiwanese readers. 

 #### Using an auction system to promote asset flow 

 Why is it meaningful? In Chapter 1, "Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST)", the specific method is to let people set the price of assets themselves, but they must pay a certain percentage of tax every year. Once someone is willing to buy at the price, the asset holder cannot refuse. 

 This is undoubtedly a practice that Taiwanese are no longer familiar with, because this is the extension of the "average land rights" proposed by Sun Wen. The concept of average land rights is to let each holder evaluate the value of the land because of the joint development of the community, and announce the value of the land he has assessed every year. 

 If the value is overestimated, a higher tax must be paid, that is, the tax is levied at the price, and if the estimated value is lower than the actual reasonable value, the government can use the valuation to buy it. Levy. 

 However, this set of practices can only be decided by the government whether to buy at the price. If the government does not act, the value of the land will not be determined. COST is adjusted so that anyone can buy at the quoted price, which means it becomes an "auction system." Through fixed taxation and market mechanisms, making holders willing to disclose the true value of assets can promote the full use of assets while preventing hoarding. 
| #### New-style democratic governance 

 Another mechanism that has been operating in Taiwan is the “Quadratic Voting (QV)” discussed in Chapter 2. The original intention of QV's design stems from the majority decision currently used in the world. It is easy to form strategic votes such as waiver of insurance, which cannot reveal the true preferences of individuals. The design of one person one vote often cannot effectively reflect the strength of opinions. 

 The QV system of "the more concentrated the voting, the more points must be paid", so that the marginal utility of each vote is exactly equal to the marginal cost. In order not to waste costs, people are more motivated to vote according to their actual preferences, thereby making the discussion of public issues more quality. 

 Taking Taiwan ’s President ’s Cup hackathon as an example, starting in 2019, we all use QV to vote for proposals. Each participant gets 99 points. One vote for a proposal is only 1 point, two votes need 4 points, and three votes need 9 points. In other words, the number of points each person pays is the square of the number of votes. 

 In the voting process of the President ’s Cup hackathon, we observed that even though people will allocate their own votes, but because of the limited number of points and the high cost of ticketing, they will not let the votes be too concentrated, so avoid The result of polarization. 

 Another example worth reading outside of Taiwan is that in 2019, the House of Representatives in Colorado adopted QV to vote on budget allocation, setting a milestone in a new form of democratic governance. The advantage of using QV is that each member of Parliament is more acceptable to such a result, because each member of Parliament tends to diversify into several different budgets, even if only one or two of them are passed, they also have contributed contributions. 

 #### Data of labor cooperatives 

 From the link between average land rights and COST, to the President ’s Cup hackathon QV, we can see that the innovation of social and democratic systems is rare in Taiwan. thing. 

 I think another practice that has the most opportunity to experiment in Taiwan is Chapter 5, "Data is Labor." In Taiwan, cooperatives and mutual aid cooperatives have a long tradition. The original intention of the cooperative was that instead of having a boss, a group of workers gathered together to decide which different jobs to take in a democratic way. The benefits created by people with different expertise must be greater than individual jobs, and it can also increase the average income of each person. This is called a labor cooperative. 

 The concept of "data is labor" is actually similar to a labor cooperative. For example, the "air box" developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a private team that can be used to monitor air quality is to open the public to participate in adoption. After the air box is spread all over Taiwan, the data is published on the zero-time air pollution observation network, so that everyone has another channel You can understand the actual air quality of Taiwan without relying entirely on the measurement stations of the Environmental Protection Agency. From this example, we can see that when data services are organized, this value is unlimited, and various uses will occur. 

 The premise of this approach is that everyone regards themselves as producers of data. I have the right to request copies, amendments, deletions, etc. of my own assets at any time. In this way, we There will be new partnerships. For example, recently, because of the demand for online purchases of masks, many people have downloaded the Health Insurance Department's "Healthcare Express" and found that the original records of the masks can be obtained at any time. On this basis, we can think about related applications, such as sharing the amount we have not received to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a proof of donation of international medical personnel. This allows direct feedback on the value of data, which is the most important meaning of "data as labor".

 The above only introduces the three methods in the book, and the rest include the "Visas Between Individuals Program (VIP)" to improve immigration through the introduction system and the "Visas Between Individuals Program (VIP)" It is forbidden for the consortium to diversify its holdings in the same field. " 

 In my opinion, the inspiration from Taiwan ’s experience to the world lies in our field experiments in life, making these theories a practical tool. Whether it is a student association, a management committee, an enterprise, or a government department, as long as new organizations or projects emerge, we can use or even evolve these participation mechanisms. 

 For example, in order to promote these methods, Glen founded the non-profit organization RadicalxChange (RxC), and I was invited to serve as a director. In the board of directors we convene every quarter, we vote with QV. Each director has 100 voting points, and anyone can propose a motion. Everyone can vote for or against the motion. The unused points can be depreciated and accumulated to the next quarter. This not only ensures that the adopted proposals are in line with the true wishes of the directors, but also promotes better discussion quality. 

 On the basis of "Radical Market", RxC continues to study how to use these mechanism designs to solve the problem of resource allocation that the market and the government cannot handle at present. For example, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and a director of RxC, developed the Quadratic Funding (QF) method based on QV. 

 This new fund-raising mechanism is designed to solve the problem of “free riders” that often appear when people use public finances. At present, the blockchain platform Gitcoin is about to experiment to the fifth round. Interested readers can refer to the paper "Liberal Radicalism: Formal Rules for a Society Neutral among Communities" co-authored by Vitalik, the author of this book, Glen and Dr. Zoë Hitzig of Harvard Economics, and Vitalik based on the analysis of the Gitcoin experiment "Review of Gitcoin Grants Analysis Report" (Review of Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Round 4). 
| #### Conclusion 

 Overview of history, there are new thoughts in every era to promote social innovation. The theories and tools extended by these thoughts are important ways to improve the human situation. 

 After sorting out the Taiwan experience, I found that "Radical Market" not only provides a batch of brand-new tools, but the seemingly radical proposals in the book are more like a new activation of the traditional "Great Harmony". 

 The concept of letting the production results and wealth be used by everyone, rather than private possession for one ’s own use, is what is said in the “Lantun Datong” article: “Goods are abandoned to the ground, and they do not need to be hidden in their own” ; Everyone uses all of his own to give substantial feedback and contribution to public issues, and it also embodies the spirit of "strengthening it not to do it out of the body, nor to be your own". 

 For Taiwanese, these practices are not only radical, but also a classical value that already exists in society. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the publication of the Chinese version of Orthodox will create more speculation and discussion, so that the "classical value of the twenty-first century" will become a new chapter in the "Great World".
