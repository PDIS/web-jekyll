On October 25, 2017, a collaborative meeting on the topic of &quot;Returning my seven days off&quot; was held at the Treasury Center. Since the labor issue is a topic of concern to many friends in Taiwan in recent years, this collaborative meeting is particularly eye-catching. 

#### I am worried that the Executive Yuan canceled a case of a work-off proposal, &quot;I still have seven days off.&quot;

The issue of &quot;I still have seven days off&quot; is due to the fact that last year, when I took a law break, it was necessary to have a national holiday. The Basic Law has been amended to return the norms of the national holiday to the &quot;Measures for the Implementation of the Day of Remembrance and Festivals&quot; of the Ministry of the Interior. Labour groups such as work buckets believe that the move is that the government bowed to the employer and cut down the seven-day national holiday. Groups such as work buckets believe that nationally agreed national holidays can reduce labor hours compared to special vacations that are not available. If you need to work overtime, you can work overtime on these days and get double pay to raise your salary. 

 After the dean of Lai Qingde took office, he thought that there was still a lot of room for adjustment in the case of a break, which caused the workers to worry about one case and then back to the old system, and the seven-day leave was cut off. Therefore, the proposal was made on the Join platform on September 15, 2017. &quot;[I am seven days off](https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/a566851f-55a0-4e7a-ac81-8968845bf867){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}&quot;, [requires the ministry of the interior to enact a national holiday law , increase the number of days of national holidays, and effectively reduce the working hours of taiwanese workers](https://issuu.com/pdis.tw/docs/2017.10.25_________________d07060b660a316){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

At the meeting, [Ministry of the Interior Report](https://issuu.com/pdis.tw/docs/2017.10.25_________________1495e774f45953){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} pointed out that the current taiwan vacation limit is limited by in 2000, the legislative yuan amended the civil service law with the accompanying resolution. the total holiday must be between 115 and 116 days. if it is to be improved, more social consensus is needed. [ministry of labor pointed out](https://issuu.com/pdis.tw/docs/2017.10.25________________){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, the workforce said &quot;Taiwan&#39;s annual working hours ranks sixth among OECD countries. The data must consider the factors of the low proportion of some working hours in Taiwan and need to be examined more carefully.

#### How much is the national holiday benefit to be studied?

In the follow-up discussion, the Ministry of the Interior pointed out that the addition of a seven-day holiday needs to clarify the cost behind it in order to consolidate social consensus. The employer’s representative believes that before the national holiday is updated, Taiwan’s industrial transformation must first be imaged in the European and American countries, and the enterprise can load the cost increased after the national holiday; but the labor representative believes that increasing the national holiday can promote the consumption of labor friends. Expanding domestic demand will also help companies. Everyone agrees that these two points of view require more research to confirm what the effects and conditions are. 

For the &quot;intensive labor inspection&quot; measures proposed by netizens, both the labor and the employer agree. The employer&#39;s representative believed that the Latif Law is the minimum law that should be observed. If a company violates the labor law to reduce costs, it should be punished to avoid vicious competition in the market; the labor also supports the strengthening of labor inspection. The Ministry of Labor pointed out that the current number of labor inspectors in the country has increased from 300 to nearly 1,000, and it is also possible to require companies to return labor overtime pay in a continuous manner. However, the Ministry of Labor colleagues also pointed out that in order to carry out the inspection of the labor site, the labor inspector must calculate the salary, overtime pay, etc. calculated by the human resources department of the company. The workload is very heavy and requires a lot of understanding.

On the issue of seven days off, the number of holidays behind, and the labor dilemmas shared by first-line workers at the conference, will be aggregated in [digital whiteboard](https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9j_k0q7rf0=/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, submitted to Tang Feng at the hospital meeting on October 30 to know the dean and the head of the relevant ministry, as a reference for future policy planning.

#### Mind map helps to see the controversy. Proposers hope to accommodate more participants.

For the outcome of the conference, the proponents said that these issues are not separated from labor and labor. The controversy, most of the issues concerning labor have been noisy. However, the second-time participant has said that through the mind map, the person who first saw the issue can see the context of the issue at a glance. He thinks it is a great practice. In terms of the format of the meeting, the sponsors considered that the format of the meeting was relatively lively and interactive, and it was not like the end of the past. However, whether the output mental map can be used as a reference within the group in the future depends on how it can be used. 

 The proposer believes that the core behind this issue is still labor relations, if [enhanced trade union organizations](http://labor.ngo.tw/about-labour/publications/702-2017-09-15-02-17-45){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, let the workers have the bargaining power to negotiate with the employers, and perhaps the labor regulations are not too fine. But now at least the labor regulations are known, and there is some progress. This meeting is not necessarily helpful for future practice, but at least it will help to clarify the issue and see the truth. As for the follow-up practice, the proponents admit that if the future is really going to be a law-based law, the biggest level is still in the Legislative Yuan. They can understand that the issues that can be dealt with at this meeting cannot be too deep.

However, the proposal can only invite five stakeholders to participate in the meeting, which the sponsor believes is still unreasonable. He hopes that such a conference in the future can invite more talents to come in, such as scholars of labor law, or can invite more workers and friends to join in and provide more views. 

#### The labor and management issues are deep and wide-focus, and more research materials are still waiting for 

The official colleagues attending the meeting observe that this time, in the form of post-it notes and mind maps, it is really novel and helpful. Everyone can see the context of the issue and help the dialogue. Some of the participants actually did to learn more about the issue. However, he is worried that such an approach is difficult to deal with the issue of industrial relations. 

 He explained that labor issues involve a wide range of different types of labor conditions, and it is difficult to find all stakeholders at once in a situation of multiple labor conditions. At the same time, even if the consensus is discussed, some labor conditions that are not considered to come may be problematic. On the other hand, under the issue of labor, many issues have different views. In terms of overtime work, some workers prefer to work overtime to earn more money, and some workers hope that the government can raise the threshold for overtime work and avoid labor exploitation. These two views conflict with each other, and how to choose is a problem. At the same time, labor issues are often politically high issues, often requiring a relatively short period of time to identify policy directions that can be implemented, which leads to many issues that do not necessarily have time to review, discuss issues, or even clarify The dilemma that will arise under different working conditions. The colleague said that under the current Taiwanese culture, people often expect the government to quickly propose solutions. Under such circumstances, there is no room for a collaborative meeting or similar form to clarify the context behind the issue for a long time. He has doubts about whether the form of collaborative meetings can deal with such diverse and broad-oriented issues. 

Moderator Zhang Fangrui believes that the back of the labor and management issues is large, and more research reports are needed to allow the meeting to be specifically focused, and then have the opportunity to further discuss and think whether there is a corresponding solution. It is a pity that because of the lack of time resources, there is no way to allow more contexts to be developed in detail.
