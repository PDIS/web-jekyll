In democracies around the world, billions of citizens have countless interests, opinions, and positions that have never been spoken. The actual state of politics is much more complicated than what the current political symbols and categories allow us to express. 

Our political choices are artificially limited by the abstract concept. These abstract concepts are not to simplify us into two opposing parties, or in the case of proportional representation, to several smaller parties. But either way, it suppresses the complexity of people's true opinions. 

There are thousands of overlapping interest groups in the world, not just two parties. There are also thousands of issues and sub-topics, not just a few topics that the media has paid attention to during the election period. 

Elections and referendums severely limit the amount of information people can send to managing political parties. For example, the current method of compressing the will of the masses into a partisan platform has made 42% of Americans now recognized as non-partisan, and their voices are excluded from the policy-making process. 

The figures in the UK are roughly the same, especially after Brexit. [Independent Report](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/new-centrist-party-politically-homeless-brexit-labour-conservative-poll-a8312991.html) shows, " Millions of voters feel politically homeless and consider supporting a new middle party... Nearly half of the respondents said they believe that no established party can act as their representative, and that the new organization will have the opportunity to win them. Vote."

As a participant in democracy, the world we see, It is largely influenced by the "public opinion representatives allow us to see what". A political party is like a very low-resolution photo that blurs out the important aspects of what voters really want and want to accept. To make matters worse, the partisan platform abandons the issue of consensus and instead prefers the issue of differentiation that is more useful for gaining power. 

 Like the Brexit referendum, including thousands of topics in a dual vote, leaving only the "left" or "left" perspective, this is the epitome of politics. This scourge of polarization and stalemate in modern politics is the result of our oversimplification of the way citizens participate, not our constitution, government structure or demographic characteristics. We live in a political two-dimensional world because we think about the tools and classifications of ourselves and others, all superficial and without depth. 

As a member of the citizenship, how can we make our political space more meaningful, and let our society as a whole have more dimensions and more detailed resolution? To answer this question, we need to find alternatives to citizen participation, not just a few key votes – such as a presidential election or a referendum like Brexit – to solve all issues. 

Office of the President's Letter of the Obama Administration, [Let's see](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/what-americans-wrote-to-obama.html) A source and process of direct public opinion. During his tenure at Obama, the White House received about 10,000 letters a day from the people. The letters were read by a group of 300 volunteers and several full-time staff members, and finally the president selected 10 letters a day. 

 These 10 letters can be regarded as the "best compromise", which broadly represents people's thoughts and feelings, and also recognizes the fact that the president cannot read and digest all the masses of letters. This is the original material that writes the people's words in their own words, inputs the artificial processing program with special empathy and quality orientation, and uses the compression algorithm to process the results. This is a process of fundamentally respecting the voice of the people. 

 However, this practice is not common. Recently, a major department of the US federal agency is facing a public comment period, with an estimated influx of nearly one million comments, but only one federal civil servant is responsible for reviewing the millions of comments. The same process goes through when dealing with the opinions of business lobbyists. 

Although we are living in an era of mass participation, everyone has a way to express their voices, but the government's structure has not yet caught up. Today's democracies have much room for improvement in the design of issues and the formulation of democratic policies. Therefore, during the election period, every issue has to face tremendous pressure when it comes to discussing space. It is conceivable that this process will make citizens feel dissatisfied and the government will not be able to obtain a clear public opinion authorization. 

We need an extensible compression mechanism to gain a deeper understanding of the rich qualitative information provided by citizens. Can the process of the "Obama Letter Office" be further automated, expanded and improved? 

Although the topic of democratic governance needs special consideration, it is not a new issue for the information industry to deal with such large-scale input. For example, Netflix promotes product decisions through automated data collection and analysis: through the wide range of behavioral data of viewers, not only can other programs be recommended to viewers, but they can also be used to provide decision-making information for new programming. The results of this analysis overturned the traditional thinking of "what people would like to see" in the past, as Janko Roettgers wrote in 2017 [in Variety magazine](https://variety.com/2017/digital /news/netflix-lab-day-behind-the-scenes-1202011105/) :

> "Netflix used to recommend content based on the region in which its users are located. After all, it is generally believed that the preferences of South American users and Canadian users should be The difference. But after careful observation, the company realized that this was not the case.” Todd Yellin, vice president of Netflix products, said: “Every day we find that such stereotypes are becoming more and more unreasonable.” Instead, Netflix will now Users are divided into 1,300 taste communities, and the way they are grouped is based entirely on viewing behavior. Each user can belong to multiple communities, and the community members are all over the world. Of course, Yelling also admits that German comedians may be more popular in Germany, but there are also many users in the United States who turn to their programs. "The most important part of "personalization" is to look for a taste community on a global scale."

Based on data analysis [category established](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/ 2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/), [really more favorable](https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/how-netflix-swallowed-tv-industry.html ), no longer a superficial "flat country" (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e5%b9%b3%e9%9d%a2%e5%9c%8b) classified "comedy" or "drama". 

In fact, Netflix divides the film into 76,000 categories, such as "The Horror of the 1980s", "Mental Food Documentary" and "Competitive System Album". Movies can also belong to multiple categories, just as viewers can belong to multiple taste communities. For Netflix, the goal is clear: more appropriate recommendations, and more views, means higher customer engagement and better retention. The more valuable the platform is, the more likely people are to recommend it, and new customers will naturally join. 

Machine learning, coupled with generous profit motives, has created the most accurate depiction of the world's film and television audiences. 

Now, Netflix (and to the rest of us) can more accurately view the messages created by large groups, as well as more details and more detailed descriptions of people's faces. Netflix can "see" the community's more preferences because they provide a more detailed description of the more complex preferences than Pepsi. If Netflix presupposes that there are only a few categories—history, drama, horror, war, and sports—it will inevitably limit the clarity of the user. In addition, this also affects the user's perception of their clarity and the language they can use to describe themselves. Imagine that if all the issues, even the issues that the government has not realized or are about to consider, all the complexities of public opinion can have the same level of detail and instant awareness, that would be a good thing. . 

Using machine learning, there is indeed a better way to present citizenship. Perhaps the significance of getting these methods into the policy-making process is to create better policy outcomes. Faced with the communication challenges inherent in the "Occupy Movement" and the "Arab Spring", we have developed Polis, an open source data science platform. 

Polis [provides a rough ethnography](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/crowdsourcing-democracy-using-wikisurveys/), showing people reaching a range of possibilities Areas of consensus and disagreement. The mathematical theory is roughly the same as the recommendation engine used by Spotify or Netflix, which is to find similarities, differences, and consensus among people. 

In the fall of 2016, I spoke at the "Citizens Science and Technology College" conference in Turin, Italy. At that time, the focus of Italy’s attention was the forthcoming constitutional referendum. The referendum will determine the fate of the power of the executive branch, as well as the presidential position of Renzi. When Renzi announced the referendum, he threatened to resign if he tried hard but could not gain centralized power (he lost and resigned). 

 At the request of the organizer, I conducted a mock review of the referendum in the private environment of 40 participants. Participants submitted comments on the referendum and they may agree or disagree with the comments submitted by other participants. Polis' machine learning algorithm runs automatically when the participant expresses a position on the statement submitted by the peer and produces a matrix of opinions. 

Try to see: change each column in the spreadsheet from "movie title" to "personal opinion", then change each column from "audience" to "elector", and finally put each cell from Change the "score" to "agree or not." In this way, the algorithm can find out the participant's opinion patterns and form a cluster. 

Some obvious clusters of opinions have emerged – those who are in favor of Renzi’s centralization, and others who are opposed. However, a statement from a single participant was unanimously supported: "The referendum is not a substitute for the election." Regardless of their position or professionalism, the participants agreed that Renzi "will resign if the referendum fails." The threat of the referendum detracted from the effectiveness of the referendum, leading to unanimous opposition from all political opponents, regardless of their original position on the Constitution. At the same time, it is obvious in other statements that some of the opponents of Renzi are actually open to the constitution. From the perspective of the dual referendum, this should be an issue of absolute polarization. However, the masses actually have complex and subtle views, are willing to weigh the various claims, and are eager to challenge the current process of communication. 

When we promote citizen participation around the world, we see the same mode of action again and again. 

In the middle of 2019, Polis has been adopted by many governments. In a compelling case in Taiwan, Polis plays the role of input data to assist [Special Uber](https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b) rulemaking. it turns out that as long as the commonalities are visualized, it can overcome the long-term stalemate of highly polarized stakeholders on complex issues, such as taiwan [alcohol online shopping](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611816/the an example of -simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/). The Canadian federal government has also carried out a number of related activities, such as "The Future of the Canadian Visual Arts Market." 

Recently in Germany, [more than 30,000 people](https://aufstehen.de/pol-is/) On Polis, nearly 2 million votes were voted on statements submitted by hundreds of people. 

In Bowling Green, Kentucky, Columbia University hosted a pilot program that invited thousands of Americans living in the Purple Zone (about 2% of the city's population) to participate. This experiment has been [written as a report](http://www.civic-assembly.org/bowling-green-report/), published in [slate](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/ 2018/12/political-polarization-bowling-green-study-kentucky-immigration.html) and reported by [civicist](https://civichall.org/civicist/testing-tech-consensus-purple-town/). 


The New Zealand Ministry of Environmental Protection is working with independent media to promote public participation with Polis; the Ministry of Culture of Singapore is also engaged in dialogue with thousands of young people. The New York City Veterans Service Department is discussing with the social workers on the front line about the traveller policy, inviting these colleagues to share their experiences in their own language and verify with colleagues. 

With a sampling strategy, such as 10,000 to 20,000 people each time, such a dialogue can easily be extended to all democratic citizens, with voting rights. Citizen gatherings of more than 10,000 people who never "shut down" are also feasible. 

The challenge we face is how to combine emerging computing methods with strong existing policy development processes. In addition, we must also jointly decide whether the model of public opinion is defined by open materials and verifiable public methods, or by proprietary proprietary methods that cannot be checked. 

In a representative democracy, not every decision is included in public participation. But when the government opens up to citizens to seek legitimacy and gain wisdom from the people's life experiences and preferences, democracy can indeed do better. The government can set major and minor issues and engage with the public. The government can also attract people in a rich and dynamic way to let citizens know how their voices are heard. The government can also invite citizens to participate in the agenda setting in the early stages of decision-making – when the number of issues that need to be resolved is greater than the number of pages in the regulation. 

In a democratic society, the ability to coordinate large-scale complexities has prompted us to rethink the various assumptions of how to represent public opinion in the past. In the future, the democratic system must face more and more effective management and integration in the face of large-scale qualitative information proposed by the people to avoid the deadlock caused by extremes. The original design of the representative system was designed to prevent the government from being controlled by the faction. In the case of democracy being sent to the hands of the faction, as citizens, we should uphold the original intention of democracy and continue to design better systems.
