"Open Government Liaison Collaboration Conference" has entered its fifth year. This channel aims to promote citizens' cooperation and create multi-party dialogue. Through the "Public Policy Network Participation Platform", citizens can participate in policies, proposals and The joint signature successfully released the imagination of many people for public policy innovation. 

In the past five years, the platform has received a dazzling array of proposals. For example, some people want to play around with their furry children, but because pets cannot take public transportation, they file a "[pet-friendly ride-sharing case](https://cm.pdis.nat.gov.tw/57/)" ; some people feel unbearable when they see the way of raising the traditional folk god pigs, and propose the "[serial joint case for terminating the weight competition of the god pig](https://cm.pdis.nat.gov.tw/ 58/)". 

These proposals not only show the needs and creativity of the public, but more importantly, highlight the spirit of collaborative meetings: whether after dinner or behind the screen, anyone's ideas and ideas can be put into practice through civic collaboration. After these proposals were signed by more than 5,000 people on the platform, various ministries and committees opened up government liaisons for careful discussion, and further voted to select them for collaboration with PDIS. This platform is not only a starting point for the communication between "public" and "civilian", but also a new node in the process of public policy discussion. 

 The "[Joint Statement on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Married Women](https://cm.pdis.nat.gov.tw/88/)" recently held a collaborative meeting is a fully inclusive example. Under current law, if a married woman wants to have an abortion, she must obtain the consent of her spouse. Therefore, in order to promote body autonomy, some female friends proposed a proposal, and it was approved by more than 7,000 people. 

After the open government liaison meeting raised the case, the Ministry of Health and Welfare immediately stated that the previously announced draft of the "Reproductive Health Care Law" has moved towards amending the provision of abortion for married women and deleting the provisions on spousal consent. The symposium is compatible, and the proposers and seconders are also invited to join. This collaboration and briefing session, including discussions on human rights, religion, family and gender equality, will move public policy in a direction that is more responsive and feasible. 

The above process fully conveys the special features of collaborative meetings that are different from traditional public hearings: stakeholders from all parties are invited to join, so that problems involving cross-departmental meetings that are temporarily difficult to be solved by a single department can be resolved during the meeting. It has been fully discussed, and the opinions of all parties have been converged. It not only allows participants with different positions from all sides to "express their aspirations", but also allows civil servants of government agencies to "clear their aspirations", and establish channels for dialogue and mutual trust with colleagues in other agencies, laying a good foundation for future inter-ministerial policy coordination. . 

Since March 2017, collaboration sessions have advanced hundreds of cases. I have mentioned that the collaborative meeting has three main purposes: to create opportunities for "public" and "civilian" dialogue, to find feasible solutions, and to introduce an open government approach. In the past five years, the cooperation of each case is the best verification of these three purposes. It also shows us that the higher the foundation of trust between the public sector and the public, the more opportunities we have to improve public policies. This will be the biggest motivator for collaborative meetings to continue.
