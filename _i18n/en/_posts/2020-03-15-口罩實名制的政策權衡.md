 🆕 The Executive Yuan formally launched the "Mask Real-name System 2.0". With the existing health insurance special drug bureau distribution system remaining unchanged, online pre-order channels have been added. The main purpose is to allow many people who have difficulty buying masks at the pharmacy due to factors such as time or distance. On the other hand, they also hope to ease the queue of pharmacies and to solve the shortage of masks in some areas. Improve the distribution efficiency and use ratio of the overall mask. Of course, there is room for improvement in any policy. Let me share with readers the following policy trade-offs that the Academy team has had in the past two weeks. 

 💻 First, [the pre-purchase website of "Mask Real-name System 2.0"](https://emask.taiwan.gov.tw/) is a revised version of the tax reporting software of the Ministry of Finance, which is stable and can be used. Get online now and more. However, this system needs to be equipped with a card reader in order to read natural person certificates or health insurance cards, but it can only operate on a computer, which is not friendly to mobile phone users. 

 📶 In view of this, in order to allow the vast majority of Chinese people to have the same opportunity to use "mask real-name system 2.0", the government team decided to concatenate the "National Health Insurance Action Autotoll" mobile service, and significantly expanded End system traffic to meet actual needs. 

 📦 Second, the distribution of "mask real-name system 2.0", from the comparison of the pharmacy three tablets a week, two Saturdays, to the distribution of fifty tablets, were once the options discussed. However, based on public health professional considerations, in order to allow the most people to obtain the basic masks required, the cycle and number of final exits are still maintained at three tablets a week in line with the pharmacy. 

 ⚖️ Third, after the inventory, the number of distribution pins that can be used for the first round of "mask real-name system 2.0" is about 7 million masks. Calculated on a set of three pieces, there are 2.33 million groups. In other words, if the number of pre-orders exceeds 2.33 million, there must be a fair way to decide who can qualify for pickup. 

 🆔 Therefore, the government team decided to use an open balloting method to generate pick-up lists when necessary. For example, the last digit of the ID card number provided by each pre-orderer can be used as a fair discrimination basis, and the successful applicant will receive the pick-up serial number of the designated supermarket through a text message. 

 🎲 The important point is that the software system can automatically generate pick-up lists in random numbers, but in terms of technology, it can meet "fairness". But in terms of "transparency", it may not be able to meet high social needs. In contrast, although the lottery is "original", it is more practical. 

 ℹ️ Finally, the pre-purchase of "mask real-name system 2.0" adopts the "registration system" rather than the "queuing system". The reason is not first-come-first-served: on the one hand, it hopes to disperse the flow of people and reduce system load pressure; , Also to avoid a few friends who have the ability to write a ticket-grabbing program, crowding out the rights of others.
