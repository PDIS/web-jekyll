 🐷 In August this year, netizen "Happy Mom" proposed on the Public Policy Network Participation Platform (Join.gov.tw) "Termination of the Sacred Pig Weight Contest", hoping to reduce the possible suffering of animals in the process. "Happy Mum" also said, "In Germany, the circus switched to 3D holographic images to replace real animals, creating the world's most fantastic circus." "In Spain, the bullfighting festival changed to inflatable bulls instead of real bullfights, so that children can Participate in it, and understand the meaning of life. ”I look forward to Taiwan ’s diversification of more friendly animals to replace traditional pig breeding and sacrifices. 

 🧩 In this case, the National Development Council, which is the competent authority of the Join platform, will first invite relevant ministries to clarify the scope of powers and responsibilities and the division of labor. On the one hand, the agricultural committee and the guest committee are the coordinating agencies, and the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Interior are the co-organizing agencies; on the other hand, it is also decided that this case should integrate the different opinions of various circles to achieve mutual understanding through collaborative meetings. 

 🙌 Based on the government's long-term governance principles, the above-mentioned four ministries also reached a basic position before the collaborative meeting: that is, when the god pig is used for sacrifice and is part of folk religion and cultural activities, governments at all levels It should not be compulsory to intervene by law or punishment. Instead, through various counselling measures, assist the pig breeder to raise the pig in a more natural way. At the same time, it can also provide more encouragement and incentives, so that temples and groups handling related activities have the opportunity to find out the sacrifice ways to maintain religious piety and take care of animal protection. 

 🌱 The theme of the collaboration meeting is therefore set to: "How to discuss the possibilities of alternative rituals on the premise of the spontaneity of the people?" 

 或许 At this point, readers may have questions: Since the government has decided not to Is there a need for a compulsory intervention? In fact, the focus of "collaboration" is not the degree of government's involvement in public power, but through the mechanism of informed discussion, all stakeholders, including the government, can actively participate in situations of rational dialogue and respect for tolerance. Listen to each other's thoughts and difficulties, thereby promoting understanding between different members of society, reducing confrontation and hostility, and keeping a complete record. 

 🌈 In conclusion, the six recommendations produced by this collaborative meeting (for details, please see: [pdis.tw/58](https://pdis.tw/58)), may not yet have any party Completely satisfied. However, such an opportunity for dialogue can indeed allow the sponsors, animal protection groups, temple representatives, and pig breeders who originally had divergent positions to take a small step forward in the same direction.
